Up 	
when the mouse is not on top of the button

Over 	
bring your mouse over the button

Down 	
Press the mouse button

Hit	
Area in the stage to which the button reacts

Registration point 
Refers to the origin point of x and Y axis
It is used to positioning and transformation. This point is located 
at the centre of the object

What is the compression technique used for longer and streaming sounds in flash ?
- ADPCM  Adaptive Differential pulse code modulation
is a technique for converting sound or analogue information to binary informations


Vector Graphics 
is a series of commands that dictate a line's direction, thickness, 
colour which gets rendered on the screen later.

Motion Tween 
Motion tween command makes sure that you have symbols in your tween 
and a keyframe at both the beginning and end of tween sequence

Vector Shape 
a shape that is represented mathematically

BITMAP IMAGE
Bitmap Image is represented by individual pixels, the computer stores the information on the color of every pixel that makes up the image.


CAST
The Cast is everything you use to create your movie eg: Graphics, Text, Video, Audio and etc.

COLOR CALIBRATION
Help to produce color image. Calibration procedure is unavoidable for high quality color reproduction.

CONTROL PANEL
Control Panel determines how the movie playes in the authoring environment. It can control the sudio volume, tempo, play, rewind and stop playback of the movie.

EYE DROPPER
Use eye dropper tool to copy fill and stroke attributes from objects. (When you click a stroke, the tool automatically changes to ink bottle tool. When you click a filled area, the tool automatically changes to paint bucket)
With eye dropper tool you can pick up colors from any open image.

FILM LOOP
Film loops are created from a sequence of sprites in the Score and converted into a single cast member in the Cast window that has a special icon indication that it is a film loop.

IMAGE RESAMPLING
It explicitly changes the number of pixels in the image.It lets you cahnge the Width and Height settings to exact number of pixels required.

Alpha 
changing the transparency of the object
Alpha can be found under the color effect tab. Alpha can change the transparency of the symbol. Thus, 100% alpha signifies that object is fully visible while 0% makes it completely transparent.


Shape Tweening 
Create an effect similar to morphing, making one shape appear to change 
into another shape over time.

Sound Compression Technique - Mp3

ACTION SCRIPT
Action Script has variables that let you store information; it has functions that let you create special commands and reuse code; it has actions that let you control the flow of a movie; it has movie clips with properties that you can change.
A command in Action Script is called a function. A function is a script that you can use over and over again in a movie to perform a certain task.
