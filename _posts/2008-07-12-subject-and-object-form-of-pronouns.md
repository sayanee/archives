There are 2 forms of pronouns:
<ol>
	<li><strong>subject </strong>form: I, you, he, she, it, we, they</li>
	<li><strong>object </strong>form: me, you, him, her, it, us, them</li>
</ol>
<div>These 2 forms are not interchangeable.
<em>Wrong</em>: My sister and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span> wanted to take a hike!  <em>Right</em>: My sisyer and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> wanted to take a hike! 
<em>Wrong</em>: Mike ran after Jack and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">she.</span>  <em>Right</em>: Mike ran after Jack and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her.</span></div>
<div>And there are some rules on where to use which form:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use subject form</span>: after <em>to be</em> verbs.
E.g. It is I. It was they. It is she.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use subject form</span>: after <em>than</em> and <em>as</em>.
E.g. Chuck is taller than I (am). Dolphins are known to be smart as they (are).</li>
</ul>
</div>
