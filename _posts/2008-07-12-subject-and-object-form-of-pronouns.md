title: Subject and Object form of Pronouns
---

There are 2 forms of pronouns:

1. **subject **form: I, you, he, she, it, we, they
2. **object **form: me, you, him, her, it, us, them

These 2 forms are not interchangeable.
- _Wrong_: My sister and me wanted to take a hike!
- _Right_: My sister and I wanted to take a hike!
- _Wrong_: Mike ran after Jack and she.
- _Right_: Mike ran after Jack and her.

And there are some rules on where to use which form:

- Use subject form: after _to be_ verbs. E.g. It is I. It was they. It is she.
- Use subject form: after _than_ and _as_. E.g. Chuck is taller than I (am). Dolphins are known to be smart as they (are).
