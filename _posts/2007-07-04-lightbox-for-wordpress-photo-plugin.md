Yes, i have been hunting for a nice display for photos and i couldn't find a better one! Here's [Lightbox 2.3](http://www.stimuli.ca/lightbox). So why do i like it?

- easy installation as a WP plugin
- clean interface when the picture is displayed
- flexibility in the position of where i want to display the thumbnail
- navigation arrows for next and previous and close
- groups pictures for display

code added for each picture... > <a rel="lightbox[group\_name]" href="/files/picture.jpeg" mce\_href="/files/picture.jpeg"Â title="Caption of this picture"><img src="/img/thumbnail.jpeg" mce\_src="/img/thumbnail.jpeg" /></a>
And here's an example! Click on any thumbnail below to see the effect of the Lightbox :) [ ![](/img/dat1_t.jpeg) ](/files/dat1.jpg "View of Tampin town from the summit") [ ![](/img/dat11_t.jpg) ](/files/dat11.jpg "At the Summit") [ ![](/img/dat12_t.jpg) ](/files/dat12.jpg "Tampin Train Station") [ ![](/img/dat18_t.jpg) ](/files/dat18.jpg "Train at the JB Station")
