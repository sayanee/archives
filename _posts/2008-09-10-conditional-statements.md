How should we tackle sentences with the following structure: "If X, then Y"

This <a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/~swang/logic.htm">simple logic</a> statement can be seen as 2 parts:
<ol>
	<li><strong>X </strong>is the hypothesis/premise/evidence</li>
	<li><strong>Y</strong> is the conclusion</li>
</ol>
<div>At any time, 4 situations can happen:</div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>X is true - If X is true, then Y is true</li>
	<li>Y is true - If Y is true, we know nothing about X</li>
	<li>X is false - If X is false, we know nothing about Y</li>
	<li>Y is false - If Y is false, then X is also false (contra positive)</li>
</ol>
</div>
