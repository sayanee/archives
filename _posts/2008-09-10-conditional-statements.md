How should we tackle sentences with the following structure: "If X, then Y" This [simple logic](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~swang/logic.htm) statement can be seen as 2 parts:

1. **X **is the hypothesis/premise/evidence
2. **Y** is the conclusion

At any time, 4 situations can happen:

1. X is true - If X is true, then Y is true
2. Y is true - If Y is true, we know nothing about X
3. X is false - If X is false, we know nothing about Y
4. Y is false - If Y is false, then X is also false (contra positive)
