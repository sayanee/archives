<strong> My Comments:</strong> Short and precise book! an enjoyable afternoon read!
<strong> Some extracts:</strong>

The QBQ (Question behind the Question) Advantage Principles are:
<ul>
	<li>Learning</li>
	<li>Ownership</li>
	<li>Creativity</li>
	<li>Service</li>
	<li>Trust</li>
</ul>
Road block to learning: Garbage Thinking
<ul>
	<li>Exception Mentality – it doesn’t apply to me!
We tend to teach to others what we need to hear ourselves</li>
	<li>Expectations – I knew it wouldn’t be any good!
How can I gain the most from today?</li>
	<li>Entitlement Thinking – I have been here for 20 years, so I deserve…!</li>
	<li>Experience Trap – The parent of a highly successful child who resist d=finding the right approach with their other children</li>
	<li>Exclusion – What do you know? You’re not a salesperson or speaker like I am!</li>
</ul>
