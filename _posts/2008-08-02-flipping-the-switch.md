**Book Title:** Flipping the Switch – 5 keys to success to work and in life ** Author: **John G. Miller ** Year written/published:** 2006 ** Book Source:** [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=g77sIAAACAAJ&dq=Flipping+the+Switch), [Library](http://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/cw_cgi?fullRecord+17482+3002+12728089+1+0) ** My Comments:** Short and precise book! an enjoyable afternoon read! ** Some extracts:** The QBQ (Question behind the Question) Advantage Principles are:
- Learning
- Ownership
- Creativity
- Service
- Trust

Road block to learning: Garbage Thinking
- Exception Mentality – it doesn’t apply to me! We tend to teach to others what we need to hear ourselves
- Expectations – I knew it wouldn’t be any good! How can I gain the most from today?
- Entitlement Thinking – I have been here for 20 years, so I deserve…!
- Experience Trap – The parent of a highly successful child who resist d=finding the right approach with their other children
- Exclusion – What do you know? You’re not a salesperson or speaker like I am!
