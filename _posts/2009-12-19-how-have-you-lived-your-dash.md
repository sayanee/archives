> There was a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a friend.?He read the dates on her tombstone from the beginning…to the end. He noted first came the date of her birth and spoke the following date with tears, but he said what mattered most of all was the dash between those years. For that dash stands for all the time that she spent alive on earth…?and only those who loved her know what that little line is worth. It matters not, how much we own; the cars….the house…the cash. What matters is how we live and love and how we spend our dash. So think about this long and hard…are there things you’d like to change??For you never know how much time is left that can still be re-arranged If we would just slow down enough to consider what’s true and real and always try to understand the way that other’s feel. We’d be much less quick to anger and show appreciation more and love the people in our lives like we’ve never loved before. So, when your eulogy’s being read and your life is being rehashed…would you be proud of the things they say about how you spent your dash?
