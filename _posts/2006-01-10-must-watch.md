I'll definitely watch [this](http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=7198)! It is releasing around 18 or 19 May and it's just nice because my exams will end my then.

It'll be my first time watching a movie after reading the book first... unlike Harry Potter or LOTR where i watched the movie and then read the books. Many times i hear comments that this particular movie did not do justice to the book and blah blah. Well, it's time for me to see for myself! Really excited to see how they'll actually show all those churches, museums and the chase from here to there...

I want to travel!!! _\*\*sweska pouts\*\*_
