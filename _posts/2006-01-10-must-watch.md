<p align="justify">I&#39;ll definitely watch <a href="http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=7198">this</a>! It is releasing around 18 or 19 May and it&#39;s just nice because my exams will end my then.
<p align="justify">It&#39;ll be my first time watching a movie after reading the book first... unlike Harry Potter or LOTR where i watched the movie and then read the books. Many times i hear comments that this particular movie did not do justice to the book and blah blah. Well, it&#39;s time for me to see for myself! Really excited to see how they&#39;ll actually show all those churches, museums and the chase from here to there...
<p align="justify">I want to travel!!! <em>**sweska pouts**</em></p>
