title: Speak like Obama
---

I thought [this article](http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/mar2008/sb2008033_156351.htm) is really good in disecting how Obama speaks so well...

1. hold out hope
2. use rhetorical device
  1. parallel structures
  2. alliteration
  3. rich imagery

4. exude body confidence
5. dynamic vocal delivery
  1. pacing
  2. volume
  3. pauses
