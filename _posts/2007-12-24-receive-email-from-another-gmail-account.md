i love gmail... and i have a few accounts. But it would be just great if i can receive all the emails from other gmail accounts into just ONE gmail account. And i learnt how to do it finally without the [common error](http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-POP-and-Forwarding/browse_thread/thread/3931e070459aa0f7/9c41d9fa43ebdd91)Â :P Here's how... eg. You want to receive all the emails from get[at]gmail[dot]com into receive[at]gmail[dot]com

1. login to get[at]gmail[dot]com
2. go to Settings -> Forwarding and POP/IMAP -> Enable POP for all emails to [enable POP access](https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=13273)
3. logout of get[at]gmail[dot]com
4. login to receive[at]gmail[dot]com
5. go to Settings -> Accounts -> Get mail from other accounts -> Add another mail account to [set up the Mail Fetcher](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=21288&topic=1577)
6. get ready to receive all the email from other account ;)
