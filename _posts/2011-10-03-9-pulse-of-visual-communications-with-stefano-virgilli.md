title: '#9 Pulse of Visual Communications with Stefano Virgilli'
---
This time I met up with Stefano Virgilli, director of [VOX Labs School of Visual Arts](http://lab.edu.sg) right on top of the Orchard Road for a little coffee on a Monday afternoon.

Ever since I have known Stef almost 3 years ago at a [Barcamp Singapore 2008](http://barcamp.org/w/page/401619/BarCampSingapore), he has always been a champion of free sharing and learning of various digital tools for 3D, animation and graphics. A very experienced graphics, 3D and animation designer himself, he is also seen at the monthly sessions at the [Creative Crew](http://creativecrew.org.sg), Adobe User Group in Singapore. He has never failed to make me see the visual or design side of things as well as explaining any technical concepts easily to a vast audience - something that Stefano does really well and i'm learning from him!

So let's hear from Stefano and his pulse on yesterday, today and tomorrow as he takes us through a journey of [Atari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari), [Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), North Italy, Singapore and Visual Communications!
