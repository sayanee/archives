The **metering** system in a digital camera measures the amount of light in the scene and calculates the best-fit exposure value based on the metering mode.

There are 3 types of metering mode:

1. Overall Metering (Multi Segment/Zone Metering)
2. Spot/Partial MeteringÂ 
3. Center Weighted Metering
