title: Speechwriter of Obama
---

[Jon Favreau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Favreau_(speechwriter\)#cite_note-Wolffe-1), just 27 years old, is the official Director of Speech for Obama. And the close communication between Favreau and Obama goes into [the process of the final speech writing](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-us-speech)...

> "The inaugural speech has shuttled between them [Obama and Favreau] four or five times, following an initial hour-long meeting in which the President-elect spoke about his vision for the address, and Favreau took notes on his computer. Favreau then went away and spent weeks on research. His team interviewed historians and speech writers, studied periods of crisis, and listened to past inaugural orations. When ready, he took up residence in a Starbucks in Washington and wrote the first draft."
