i admit... i have become an idler.

When i am alone, nothing gives me greater pleasure than to pomp myself on the bed, with my pillow at the back and a book in my hand... reading away the whole afternoon while the lovely afternoon sun pears through my window. Occasionally mom's tamarind _achar_ helps a lot too. So, just if you're wondering... the best gift for me would be a **book voucher** anytime :P
