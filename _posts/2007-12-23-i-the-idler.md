i admit... i have become an idler.
<p align="justify">When i am alone, nothing gives me greater pleasure than to pomp myself on the bed, with my pillow at the back and a book in my hand... reading away the whole afternoon while the lovely afternoon sun pears through my window. Occasionally mom's tamarind <em>achar</em> helps a lot too. So, just if you're wondering... the best gift for me would be a <strong><font color="#800000">book voucher</font></strong> anytime :P</p>
