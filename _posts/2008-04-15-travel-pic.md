Nope, my personal pics are barely enough expect for Berlin and Brussels where I had the luck to meet my 2 good school friends and they helped me take pics.Â Oh no! I just realised I have no evidence of Amsterdam visit :P But then again, in 2 weeks my parents will also be here with a DSLR *cross finger* and i can't wait for that as well.</p>
