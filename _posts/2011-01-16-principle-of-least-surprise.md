<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">POLA (Principle of Least Astonishment) or POLS (Principle of Least Surprise)</a>, from the <a href="http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html">Philosophy of Ruby</a>:
<blockquote>it's called the "principle of least surprise." I believe people want to express themselves when they program. They don't want to fight with the language. Programming languages must feel natural to programmers. I tried to make people enjoy programming and concentrate on the fun and creative part of programming when they use Ruby.</blockquote>
~ Yukihiro Matsumoto, creator of Ruby

and the <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/ruby4.html">human factor</a>:
<blockquote>Imagine you are writing an email. You are in front of the computer. You are operating the computer, clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard, but the message will be sent to a human over the internet. So you are working before the computer, but with a human behind the computer. Most of the tasks we do are for humans. For example, a tax calculation is counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet, but government consists of humans.

Most of our tasks are related to humans after all.</blockquote>
~ Yukihiro Matsumoto, creator of Ruby
