Happy New Year everyone!! While all of us are busy doing the yearly reflections and resolutions, the thought of coming up with a "mission statement" for the next year suddenly popped into my mind. It shall be **Neoteny Venture 2010**. I first heard the word _neoteny_ through the [Singapore Camp conferences](http://nsc1.neotenylabs.com/). Although it is a [biological word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny), I very much loved the concept - retaining childlike attributes into the adulthood. And coupled with the word _venture_, I combined them to mean playful adventures and experimentation throughout the next year. That sounds fun! Have a great time in the countdown parties :D I'm off to to begin my ventures as well... ![](/img/neoteny-venture-2010.jpg)
