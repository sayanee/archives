Happy New Year everyone!!

While all of us are busy doing the yearly reflections and resolutions, the thought of coming up with a "mission statement" for the next year suddenly popped into my mind. It shall be <strong>Neoteny Venture 2010</strong>.

I first heard the word <em>neoteny</em> through the <a href="http://nsc1.neotenylabs.com/">Singapore Camp conferences</a>. Although it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny">biological word</a>, I very much loved the concept - retaining childlike attributes into the adulthood. And coupled with the word <em>venture</em>, I combined them to mean playful adventures and experimentation throughout the next year.

That sounds fun! Have a great time in the countdown parties :D I'm off to to begin my ventures as well...
