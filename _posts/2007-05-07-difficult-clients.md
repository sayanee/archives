	<li>I’m not sure what I want, and I won’t pay if I don’t like it</li>
	<li>I have a few other designers in mind, can you create a few mock-ups and maybe I’ll pick you?</li>
	<li>I’m not comfortable with a contract/up-front deposit, can we go without it?</li>
	<li>I thought this was supposed to be coded? I’d like my money back</li>
</ol>
