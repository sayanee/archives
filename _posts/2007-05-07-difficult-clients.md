found an interesting article [right here](http://freelanceswitch.com/clients/12-breeds-of-client-and-how-to-work-with-them/) about the 12 different types of difficult clients and how to work with them... and the types of clients are...

1. The Low-Tech Client
2. The Uninterested Client
3. The Hands-On Client
4. The Paranoid Client
5. The Appreciative Client
6. The Get-a- Good-Deal Client
7. The I’ll-Know-It -When-I-See-It Client
8. The Always-Urgent Client
9. The Decision-By- Committee Client
10. The Doormat Client
11. The Budget Client
12. The You-Should- Be-So-Lucky Client

and [another similar](http://www.designersmind.com/articles/five-reasons-to-turn-down-a-potential-client/) article points out 5 types of clients we should reject.... and there are 5 types of them...
1. I don’t have any money, but this will get you some great exposure!
2. I’m not sure what I want, and I won’t pay if I don’t like it
3. I have a few other designers in mind, can you create a few mock-ups and maybe I’ll pick you?
4. I’m not comfortable with a contract/up-front deposit, can we go without it?
5. I thought this was supposed to be coded? I’d like my money back
