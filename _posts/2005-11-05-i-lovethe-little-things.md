<p align="justify">Firstly, I <strong>HATE</strong> court shoes!!!... why on earth must we wear this painful, ever-scratching, skin peeling, making-red-skin shoes for formal presentations?!?!</p>
<p align="justify">For the past few days I was having a bit of distractions. This little voice beside me wanted to play and talk. Yesterday this little voice kept pestering me… when I turned around I saw this….aaaaaaaawwwwwwww she melted my heart. My little 6 year old cousin. Isn’t she cute?? She’s the last of my generation because after that is the starting of the nieces and nephews!</p>

<p align="justify">Let me also declare my utmost love for my gal group. <strong>Memories</strong> shared with them…I’ll never forget. We had lots of fun <strong>pigging out</strong> until the late nights camping in E1 classrooms, arguing our thoughts and having endless discussions with ideas flowing here and there. I am very proud of them and what we created after hard work. Hope it pays off soon! It’s not easy to work with 8 people in a group bit still I think we have a great team dynamics and i learnt a lot from them. And yes thank you for listening to my comments and ramblings about anything and everything and those annoying debatable ramblings!! I guess when we go through a hurdle together it makes our <strong>friendship</strong> even stronger…</p>
