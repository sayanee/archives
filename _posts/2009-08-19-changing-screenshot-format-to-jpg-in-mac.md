So the default image for screen shots in MAC is png. And we can change it to jpg! Tom Merrit shows how to do it in Cnet's "How to" podcast:

1. Open Terminal
2. type in: defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg
3. Log in again
4. Test it: Shift+Cmd+4
5. the picture file created is in jpg :P

Here's another post on [how to change the default format](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050627224051361)!
