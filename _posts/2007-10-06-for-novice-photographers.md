i really loved the points in [this article ](http://digital-photography-school.com/blog/11-tips-for-beginner-photographers/)from one of my fav blogs, DPS... tips for beginner photographers... and i couldn't agree more especially with number 3. And with a small point and shoot and free web resource, anyone can simply enjoy photography :) ... the tips are...

1. Don’t go crazy buying the most expensive equipment right away.
2. Consider a tripod.
3. **Keep your camera with you all the time.**
4. Make a list of shots you’d like to get.
5. Don’t overlook mundane subjects for photography.
6. Enjoy the learning process.
7. Take advantage of free resources to learn.
8. Experiment with your camera’s settings.
9. Learn the basic rules.
10. Take photos regularly.
11. Don’t be afraid to experiment.
