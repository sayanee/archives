<strong> Some extracts:</strong>

The time to look for a new job is when you don’t need one. The time to switch jobs is before it feels comfortable. Go. Switch. Challenge yourself,  get yourself a raise and a promotion. You owe it to your career and your skills.

3 questions to ask before quitting:
<ol>
	<li>Am I panicking?</li>
	<li>Who am I influencing?</li>
	<li>What sort of measurable progress am I making?</li>
</ol>
So, there’s tool number one. If quitting is going to be a strategic decision that enables you to make smart choices in the marketplace, then you should outline your quitting strategy before the discomfort sets in.
