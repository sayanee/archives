<a class="vt-p" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl">Sophia Magdalena Scholl</a> (May 9, 1921 - February 22, 1943) was a member of the White Rose non-violent resistance movement in Nazi Germany. She was convicted of treason after having been found distributing anti-war leaflets at the University of Munich with her brother Hans. As a result, they were both executed by guillotine.
