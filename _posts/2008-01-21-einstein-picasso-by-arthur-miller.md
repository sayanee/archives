<p align="justify">Nor were the 2 men’s personal working styles dissimilar. Both came to terms early on with loneliness of the creative effort. As Einstein wrote some years late, “I live in the solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity.” Picasso recalled the “Unbelievable solitude” he felt when working on Les Demoiselles d’Avignon.</p>

The contemplation of this world beckoned like a liberation." Einstein had found his calling: solve the riddle.</p>
