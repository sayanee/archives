Many artists were also visually intrigued by the platonic solids too. This painting called _ [The Sacrament of the Last Supper](http://www.fulcrumgallery.com/print_25282.aspx)_ by [Salvador Dali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD) shows a huge [dodecahedron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron) (a twelve-faced Platonic solid in which each side is a pentagon).
