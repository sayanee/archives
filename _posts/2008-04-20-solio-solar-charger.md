title: SOLIO - solar charger
---

Here's another new gadget that i'm in love with: [SOLIO](http://www.solio.com/charger/). All it needs is the sun and it can charge almost any handheld device! Here are some of the [facts from the website](http://www.solio.com/charger/explore-solio/how-it-works.html):

- Charging Solioâ€™s internal battery takes 8-10 hours of direct sunlight.
- Solio will charge your device at the same rate as your conventional charger.
- Using the included wall adapter or USB charging cable solio will fully charge in approximately 4 hours.
- A fully charged Solio will completely charge an average cell phone at least twice.
- When charging a cell phone directly from the sun, 60 minutes of sunlight will provide approximately 25 minutes of talk time and ten hours of standby time.
- When charging an iPod directly from the sun, one hour of sunlight will provide about one hour of play time.
- Solio can store energy on its internal battery for up to one year.
