Here's another new gadget that i'm in love with: <a href="http://www.solio.com/charger/">SOLIO</a>. All it needs is the sun and it can charge almost any handheld device! Here are some of the <a href="http://www.solio.com/charger/explore-solio/how-it-works.html">facts from the website</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Charging Solioâ€™s internal battery takes 8-10 hours of direct sunlight.*</li>
	<li>Solio will charge your device at the same rate as your conventional charger.</li>
	<li>Using the included wall adapter or USB charging cable solio will fully charge in approximately 4 hours.</li>
	<li>A fully charged Solio will completely charge an average cell phone at least twice.*</li>
	<li>When charging a cell phone directly from the sun, 60 minutes of sunlight will provide approximately 25 minutes of talk time and ten hours of standby time.*</li>
	<li>When charging an iPod directly from the sun, one hour of sunlight will provide about one hour of play time.*</li>
	<li>Solio can store energy on its internal battery for up to one year.</li>
</ul>
