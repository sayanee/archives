<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

Identifying with the body’s intelligence
<ol>
	<li>You have a higher purpose</li>
	<li>You are in communion with the whole of life</li>
	<li>Your awareness is always opento change. From moment to moment it senses everything in your environment</li>
	<li>You feel acceptance for all others as your equal, without judgment of prejudice</li>
	<li>You seize every moment with renewed creativity, not clinging to the old and outworn</li>
	<li>You being is cradled in the rhythms of theuinverse. You feel safe and nurtured</li>
	<li>You idea of efficiency if to let the flow of life bring you what you need</li>
	<li>You feel a sense of connection with your source</li>
	<li>You are committed to giving as the source of all abiundance</li>
	<li>You see all change, including birth and death, against the background of immortality.</li>
</ol>
How to seek within:
<ol>

	<li>Don’t resist what’s happening inside</li>
	<li>Open yourself to the unknown</li>

	<li>Reach beyond yourself</li>
	<li>Be genuine, speak the truth</li>
	<li>Let the center be your home</li>
</ol>
I can fall back on a few simple steps when I find myself being overshadowed by anything:
<ol>
	<li>I say to myself, :This situation may be shaking me, but I am more than any situation.”</li>
	<li>I take a deep breath and focus my attention on whatever ny body is feeling</li>
	<li>I step back and see myself as another person would see me</li>
	<li>I realize that my emotions are not reliable or reacting to</li>
	<li>I realize that my emotions are not guides to what is permanent and real</li>
	<li>If I am about to burst out with uncontrollable reactions I walk away</li>
</ol>
Causes of suffering:
<ul>
	<li>overlooking actual facts</li>
	<li>adopting a negative perception</li>
	<li>reinforcing that perception by obsessive thinking</li>
	<li>getting lost in the pain without looking for a way out</li>
	<li>comparing yourself to others</li>
	<li>cementing the suffering through relationships</li>
</ul>
How to choose without getting trapped:
<ol>
	<li>Make the most of every experience</li>
	<li>don’t obsess over right and wrong decisions</li>
	<li>stop defending your slef-image</li>
	<li>GO beyond risks</li>
	<li>make no decision when in doubt</li>
	<li>see the possibilities in whatever happens</li>
	<li>find the stream of joy</li>
</ol>
Universal principles:
<ol>
	<li>the events in my life reflect who I am</li>
	<li>the people in my life reflect aspects of myself</li>
	<li>whatever I pay attention to will grow</li>
	<li>nothing is random</li>
	<li>at any given moment, the universe is giving me the best results possible</li>
	<li>my inner awareness is always evolving</li>
	<li>the direction of life is from duality to unity</li>
	<li>If I open myself to the force of evolution of evolution, it will carry me where I want to go</li>
	<li>The fragmented mind cannot get me to unity, but I have to use it along the way</li>
	<li>I am living in many dimensions at once; the appearance of bring trapped in time and space is just an illusion</li>
</ol>
some questions…
<ul>
	<li>Who am I? You are the totality of the universe acting through a human nervous system</li>
	<li>Where did I come from? You came from a source that was never born and will never die</li>
	<li>Why am I here? To create the world in every moment</li>
</ul>
