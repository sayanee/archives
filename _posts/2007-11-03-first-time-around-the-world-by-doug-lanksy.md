a tip for the drivers...
<blockquote>have multiple copies of everything. Even get some colour copies of your driving license laminated so you can leave them with the border guards who threaten to hold them for bribe.</blockquote>
benifits of travelling solo...
<blockquote>You learn about yourself. You'll find out what your likes and dislikes are, and be able to act on them. ... ...Â  You'll spend more time writing your journal, taking photos, reading, studying the culture - absorbing more of the country you're travelling in. You'll be less distracted by a friend and more likely to notice the small things happening around you. As a single traveller it can be easier to blend in ... ...

women travelling alone: The trick is being able to distinguish between a tactless man and a dangerous one. Always trust your instincts. If you feel at risk, simple move to another compartment with safe-looking people, head to a more crowded street or stop a police officer.</blockquote>
daily costs: lowest type...
<blockquote>Daily expences in developing countries: $10; monthly: $300; yearly:$3650
Daily expences in developed countries: $22; monthly: $660; yearly:$8030
Lifestyle: Sleeping in hostel dorms, sharing rooms in the very cheapest hostels, camping, resting, sleeping on trains and buses. Eating cheapest food. No clubbing. Limited museums and no longering drinks at nice cafes.</blockquote>
