I am on a row of hitting and injuring myself since the weekend!

1. hit my **head** on my study table when i was about to get up from the floor
2. Pricked my **fingers** with the pointed solders at the back of the PCBs
3. Punched the **knuckles** of some uncoordinated guy during Body Combat. When the hole room was going left he had to go right and punch me right on the knuckles...urgh!!!
4. Slipped a 1kg weight and it had to land on my **toes** right after Body Pump.
5. poked my **palm** when the screw driver slipped out of the screw.
6. Scalded a 2mm radius **skin** on my finger thanks to soldering iron!!!!

But the most suay had to be a total mental shock!! There was a sudden **spot check** on your all your **files and folders** during the lab.

There was a seniors' report in my file and it got added to the confiscated pile of other reports... How **SUAY** can i get!??!?! phew...time to recuperate now.
