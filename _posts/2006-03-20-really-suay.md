I am on a row of hitting and injuring myself since the weekend!

1. hit my <strong>head</strong> on my study table when i was about to get up from the floor
2. Pricked my <strong>fingers</strong> with the pointed solders at the back of the PCBs
3. Punched the <strong>knuckles</strong> of some uncoordinated guy during Body Combat. When the whole room was going left he had to go right and punch me right on the knuckles...urgh!!!
4. Slipped a 1kg weight and it had to land on my <strong>toes</strong> right after Body Pump.
5. poked my <strong>palm</strong> when the screw driver slipped out of the screw.
6. Scalded a 2mm radius <strong>skin</strong> on my finger thanks to soldering iron!!!!

But the most suay had to be a total mental shock!!
There was a sudden <strong>spot check</strong> on your all your <strong>files and folders</strong> during the lab. There was a seniors' report in my file and it got added to the confiscated pile of other reports...

How <strong>SUAY</strong> can i get!??!?! phew...time to recuperate now.
