<strong>Summary: </strong>Discovering your Passion and creating the life you choose to live
<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

By William Barclay....
<blockquote>There are 2 great days in a person's life - the day we are born and the day we discover why.</blockquote>
Intention, Attention, No tension...
<blockquote>Intention: consciously stating what you choose to create in your life is the first step to manifesting it

Attention: Give attention to what you choose to create in your life, and it will begin to show up

No Tension: Where you are open to waht is appearing in this moment, you allow God's will to move through you.</blockquote>
clarity of what you want...
<blockquote>When you are clear, what you want will show up in your life, and only to the extent that you are clear.</blockquote>
the why... by Neitzsche...
<blockquote>He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.</blockquote>
