I thought I just had to re-post this as quoted [from Paolo Coelho'a blog](http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2010/07/15/rabindranath-tagore/).

> Spiritual life is the emancipation of consciousness. Through it we find immediate response of soul everywhere. Before we attain this life, we see men through the medium of self-interest, prejudice or classification, because of the perpetual remoteness around us which we cannot cross over. When the veil is removed, we not only see the fleeting forms of the world, but come close to its eternal being, which is ineffable beauty. Some seek for the evidence of spiritual truth in the outside world. In this quest one may stumble upon ghosts or some super-sensual phenomenon of nature, but these do not lead us to spiritual truth, as new words in a dictionary do not give us literature. So busy used I to be under the belief that I was indispensable, that I hardly dared to wink. My doctor now and again would warn me, saying: “Stop, take it easy.” But I would reply: “How will things go on if I stop?” Just then my health failed me, the wheels of my car broke down and it came to a stop beneath this window. From here **I looked out upon the limitless space**. There I saw whirling the numberless flashing wheels of the triumphal chariot of time,–no dust raised, no din, not even a scratch left on the roadway. On a sudden I came to myself. I clearly perceived **that things could get along without me**. There was no sign that those wheels would stop, or drag the least bit, for lack of anyone in particular. But is this to be admitted so easily as all that! Even if I admit it in words, my mind refuses assent. If it be really quite the same whether I go or stay, how then did my pride of self find a place in the universe, even for a moment? On what could it have taken its stand? Amidst all the plentifulness with which space and time are teeming, it was nevertheless not possible to leave out this self of mine. **The fact that I am indispensable is proved by the fact that I am.** THE question is: “In which Truth is my entity to realise its fullest value,–in Power or in Love?” If we accept Power as that truth we must also recognize conflict as inevitable and eternal. Thought Relics by Rabindranath Tagore
