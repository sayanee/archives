i'm learning about many dimensions of a corporation. Some companies deals with consumer goods - food, industrial resources while others deals with services - airline, hotel, insurance, hospital, etc. And some companies operate to deal with purely other businesses!

A [holding company ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company)own a part of another company's stocks. Famous examples would include Singapore's [Temasek Holdings ](http://www.temasekholdings.com.sg/)and Warren Buffett's [Berkshire Hathaway Inc](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/). This list i found [here](http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/COHN/largest_commercial_banks.htm) includes many banks as holding companies.

A [conglomerat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company))e is a large company which consists of divisions of often seemingly unrelated businesses. Some famous examples would include [East India Company ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_East_India_Company)and a media comglomerate would be the [Time Warner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner). Here's another [list of conglomerates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conglomerates).
