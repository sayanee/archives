I went to the supermarket to buy a toothpaste because i'm almost finishing it! And for 20 minutes i was walking everywhere finding it... you see this is even bigger than Ang Mo Kio NTUC. And then i landed in a huge area full of _la fromage...Cheese..._ I have never seen so much cheese in my life!!

Maybe only in this country one can find soo many types of Cheese. I remember when i went to the Loire Valley, Monsieur Pascal told us there are infact 360+ cheese and so you can taste each one on every day of the year... so anybody wants me to bring over some cheese for you? ;)
