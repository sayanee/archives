<p>A book by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Guest">edgar guest</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Now” - said a good book unto me -<br />
“Open my pages and you shall see<br />
Jewels of wisdom and treasures fine,<br />
Gold and silver in every line,<br />
And you may claim them if you but will<br />
Open my pages and take your fill.</p>
<p>“Open my pages and run them o’er,<br />
Take what you choose of my golden store.<br />
Be you greedy, I shall not care -<br />
All that you seize I shall gladly spare;<br />
There is never a lock on my treasure doors,<br />
Come - here are my jewels, make them yours!</p>
<p>“I am just a book on your mantel shelf,<br />
But I can be part of your living self;<br />
If only you’ll travel my pages through,<br />
Then I will travel the world with you.<br />
As two wines blended make better wine,<br />
Blend your mind with these truths of mine.</p>
<p>“I’ll make you fitter to talk with men,<br />
I’ll touch with silver the lines you pen,<br />
I’ll lead you nearer the truth you seek,<br />
I’ll strengthen you when your faith grows weak -<br />
This place on your shelf is a prison cell,<br />
Let me come into your mind to dwell!”</p></blockquote>
