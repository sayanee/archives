A book by [edgar guest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Guest)

>

> “Now” - said a good book unto me -  
“Open my pages and you shall see  
Jewels of wisdom and treasures fine,  
Gold and silver in every line,  
And you may claim them if you but will  
Open my pages and take your fill.

> “Open my pages and run them o’er,  
Take what you choose of my golden store.  
Be you greedy, I shall not care -  
All that you seize I shall gladly spare;  
There is never a lock on my treasure doors,  
Come - here are my jewels, make them yours!

> “I am just a book on your mantel shelf,  
But I can be part of your living self;  
If only you’ll travel my pages through,  
Then I will travel the world with you.  
As two wines blended make better wine,  
Blend your mind with these truths of mine.

> “I’ll make you fitter to talk with men,  
I’ll touch with silver the lines you pen,  
I’ll lead you nearer the truth you seek,  
I’ll strengthen you when your faith grows weak -  
This place on your shelf is a prison cell,  
Let me come into your mind to dwell!”
