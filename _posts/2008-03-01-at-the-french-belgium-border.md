_Madames et Monsiuers_ Before it was too long, i was whisked away from Charles de Gaulles along l'autoroute A2 towards north of France. Darlings Sweska is finally in France!!!

I seriously would have loved to write more - french keyboard adventures, working under carriage beside connifer forest amidst the strong northern winds, speaking in broken french and still getting smiles from the rail station's info counter etc etc. In an hours' time i will be catching my first eurail to the world's most glamorous city - Paris!! So i gotta rush!!!

_Au Revoir mes amies_  I'll write soon with stories written along the Champs-Elysees on the River Seine.

The adventure begins now!!
