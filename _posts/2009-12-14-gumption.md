I just read this in the Free [eBook by Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/files/what-matters-now-1.pdf)... the last entry on Gumption.

> Most of us settle in, and settle for what we have. Rather than pursue, we accept. Our lives become **_unwitting celebrations of passivity_**: we undervalue our work and perceive ourselves as wage slaves (and so we phone it in at the day gig), we consume compulsively (but not create), we pine for better lives (but live vicariously through our televisions). These corners we paint ourselves into, it's no way to live. There's no adventure here, no passion, no hunger for change. Remember that relentless optimism you once had? The goals you wished to achieve, before settling in? They're still there. You need a nudge to find them; a little gumption.

...

> _**Declare war on passivity**_ Hush the inner voice that insists you're over the hill, past your prime, unworthy of attaining those dreams. Disbelief is now the enemy, as is the notion of settling. Get hungry — hyena hungry. Get fired up. Find your backbone, and your wings. Flap ‘em. It's the only way you'll be able to fly.

I think I know my motto for 2010: **Declare war on passivity** :)
