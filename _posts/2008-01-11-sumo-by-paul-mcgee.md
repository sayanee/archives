<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

some quotations…
<blockquote>People tend to overestimate what they can achieve in a year, and underestimate what they can achieve in a lifetime
~Anthony Robbins

At the end of the day do not be the kind of person who says I wish I had, I wish I had, I wish I had. Be the kind of person who says I’m glad I did, I’m glad I did, I’m glad I did.
~Zig Ziglar</blockquote>
Avoid Victim Language… replace with SUMO language…
<ol>
	<li>Life is not fair – I am unhappy about that, what can I do?</li>
	<li>This is just the way I am – How can I improve?</li>
	<li>There’s nothing I can do – There’s always something I can do</li>
	<li>It’s impossible – let’s find a way</li>
	<li>Who is to blame? – How can we move forward?</li>
	<li>I am a victim – I am a survivor</li>
</ol>
TEAR Thinking: Thinking -&gt; Emotions -&gt; Actions -&gt; Results

Fruity Thinking:
<ol>
	<li>I am worth more because of who I am, not because of what I do</li>
	<li>I learn from the past but I do not remain rooted in it. I know ehn to let go and when to move on.</li>
	<li>I am responsible. I have choices. No one else plays as big a role in determining my destiny as I do.</li>
	<li>I choose to major on the majors. I am aware of the big picture and focus on what is important. I see things in perspective.</li>
</ol>
top 3 tips for Hippo Times (times when you truly need a period for wallowing eg. death, loss of job, accident etc)
<ol>
	<li>Be careful of who you talk to</li>
	<li>Be careful how many people you talk to (to re-tell is to relive)</li>
	<li>be careful how long your Hippo time lasts</li>
</ol>
Why do we procrastinate:
<ol>
	<li>Avoiding discomfort</li>

</ol>
Some questions for inner coaching:
