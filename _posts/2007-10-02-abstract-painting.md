This is how we can easily create an abstract painting:

1. spot a sunset from the ground
2. get irritated that the view is always getting blocked by the ground buildings and trees
3. run to the nearest HDB block and go to the highest floor facing slightly to the west
4. snap snap snap
5. come home and edit :D

have you noticed the sunsets recently?? they are really beautiful i think!
