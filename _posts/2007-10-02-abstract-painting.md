This is how we can easily create an abstract painting:
<ol>
	<li>spot a sunset from the ground</li>
	<li>get irritated that the view is always getting blocked by the ground buildings and trees</li>
	<li>run to the nearest HDB block and go to the highest floor facing slightly to the west</li>
	<li>snap snap snap</li>
	<li>come home and edit :D</li>
</ol>
have you noticed the sunsets recently?? they are really beautiful i think!
