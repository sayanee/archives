Tucked away in the corner of Arab Street, on a hot Saturday afternoon, I got the chance to chat with my designer friend, [Carlsson](https://twitter.com/#!/flubberzz) who runs [ Carlsche Media, ](http://www.carlschemedia.com/)a creative design agency and hops in to organise [Creative Crew meetups in](http://www.creativecrew.org.sg/) Singapore!
