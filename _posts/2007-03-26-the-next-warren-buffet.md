<p align="justify">Warren Buffet, the world's second richest man says this about the qualities a person should have if he wants to be the next warren buffet...</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Over time, markets will do extraordinary, even bizarre, things. A single, big mistake could wipe out a long string of successes. We therefore need someone genetically <font color="#800000">programmed to recognize and avoid serious risks</font>, including those never before encountered. Certain perils that lurk in investment strategies cannot be spotted by use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions.</p>
<p align="justify">Temperament is also important. <font color="#800000">Independent thinking, emotional stability</font>, and a keen <font color="#800000">understanding of both human and institutional behavior</font> is vital to long-term investment success. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues.</p>
