<p align="justify">A hurried post amidst the last minute meet ups before we leave for Singapore!!</p>
<p align="justify">Everytime i leave this place, i get this really strange feeling - i might just be seeing someone for the very last time. I wish we could come back more often and for shorter periods of time (yeah ironically!). It was great seeing so many of my dear ones and hearing your stories. And yes i know i have obviously taken a huge task of compiling and editting 1000+ pics and 3 hours of videos... priceless memories to add to our collection.</p>
<p align="justify">Amidst the distance we are still holding on.... holding on strongly to each other. Gonna miss you all... *muaks* </p>
