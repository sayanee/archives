<p align="justify">I cannot believe that i wouldÂ be able to show you all <a href="/2006/09/18/something-about-roof-tops/">the roof top that i was talking about </a>so fast. I went back to my childhood neighbourhood yesterday. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sweska/171807118/">My house</a> isn't there anymore. It has already been demolished and replaced with a block of flat. But i really wanted to go to the top of the flat building to feel the space once again... the ironic space amidst the beautiful clutter!</p>
<p align="justify">Thankfully, the people in the neighbourhood recognised my dad as the <em>borobabu</em> of the old family that once used to reside in that neighbourhood. And immediately one of them took us up on the roof top.</p>
<p align="justify">It was a very emmotional moment for me... i didn't come to this place for almost 12 years. And so, i went up and i was standing amidst the same neighbourhood, but on the new roof top. The surroundings was exactly the same. The connected roof tops, the brown bricks and endless view of houses - all under the sky. I started recalling all my playtimes right here.</p>
<p align="justify">It's so strange what time does to people and things. Somehow neither seems to change...</p>
