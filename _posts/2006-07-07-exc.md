We learnt, we cried, we struggled, we grew up a lot. But most importantly we 10 of us created a lot of havoc in Cedar... exactly how? Only we know ;)

<p align="justify">We met up again this time... yes not all the 10 were here. But memories will still remain. Being part of this team made me learn a lot and these qualities will carry me through out in my life and career. Even now when i do the filing stuff for dad i remember Chunli, or when i was doing the finance statements i remembered Alicia. When huiling and lilin were part of my project group 2 semesters back, i was not surprised that both were still willing to sit down and discuss all view points and keep finding better ways to present a certain idea.</p>
<p align="justify">Personally, i learnt to talk in front of 1000 people overcoming my nerves, I learnt to cry cry cry and hide my tensions in solitude, i learnt to gulp down the horrible failures in grades and still continue, and those sore throats after leading the school in cheers, learnt to keep my mouth shut even when the physics teacher complained, coming home so late every night to a worried tensed mom, learnt humility in leadership, taught me team dynamics, event management... haha... it certainly toughened us all.</p>
<p align="justify">I'll never forget... I hope we continue to keep this friendship for many many years to come... this friendship is precious. We met not as friends... but we became one.</p>
<p align="justify">Thanks to each of you!! Each one of you have definitely been an inspiration for me.</p>
