It's been 4 and a half years since <a class="vt-p" href="/this-is-the-start/">my first post</a>.

Other than writing about myself, I had no idea what i would write about when i first started. So I had categories that basically depicted how i spent my time. Through the years of inconsistent blogging and recounting my experiences, I am <em>changing</em> and I am <em>evolving.</em> Thankfully, I am finding my way through towards a focus.

And I thought, I would write more about this focus. I have thus created 4 categories as shown in the side bar... they are simply:
<ol>
	<li>Technology</li>
	<li>Ideas</li>
	<li>Productivity</li>
	<li>Strategy</li>
</ol>

As i go into this year, I am also getting involved in a few interesting projects as i continue with my <a class="vt-p" href="/neoteny-venture-2010/">Neoteny Venture 2010</a>. Through these ideas and explorations, in the web-sphere you can also find me at...
