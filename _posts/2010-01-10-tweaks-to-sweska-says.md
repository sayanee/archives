It's been 4 and a half years since [my first post](/this-is-the-start/).  Other than writing about myself, I had no idea what i would write about when i first started. So I had categories that basically depicted how i spent my time. Through the years of inconsistent blogging and recounting my experiences, I am _changing_ and I am _evolving._ Thankfully, I am finding my way through towards a focus.  And I thought, I would write more about this focus. I have thus created 4 categories as shown in the side bar... they are simply:

1. Technology
2. Ideas
3. Productivity
4. Strategy
