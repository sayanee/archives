<p align="justify">Went to the Victoria Concert Hall to hear the final round of the Open Category of the <strong>National Piano and Violin Competition</strong>... awestruck!</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="/img/DSC02231.jpg" /></p>
<p align="justify">I heard 1 piano concerto played by 3 different contestants – <em>Saint-Saens, Piano Concerto No. 2 in G Minor Op. 22.</em> I totally fell in love with the 3rd movement and loved the <strong>crescendo</strong>, running notes and especially the <strong>imitation</strong> by the piano then the orchestra... they are all so skilled! Makes me think about what on earth I am doing!?!?!? haha...<strong>inspiration!</strong> I think Kendrick will win and he will now join the ranks of Abigail and Claire. And another question – how can they memorise 30 minutes concertos while I’m already struggling with 4 page exam pieces! And I also heard 2 violin concertos. I have never tried my hands on a string instrument before... shall try it one day!</p>
