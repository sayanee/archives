Went to the Victoria Concert Hall to hear the final round of the Open Category of the **National Piano and Violin Competition**... awestruck!

I heard 1 piano concerto played by 3 different contestants – _Saint-Saens, Piano Concerto No. 2 in G Minor Op. 22._ I totally fell in love with the 3rd movement and loved the **crescendo**, running notes and especially the **imitation** by the piano then the orchestra... they are all so skilled! Makes me think about what on earth I am doing!?!?!? haha...**inspiration!** I think Kendrick will win and he will now join the ranks of Abigail and Claire. And another question – how can they memorise 30 minutes concertos while I’m already struggling with 4 page exam pieces! And I also heard 2 violin concertos. I have never tried my hands on a string instrument before... shall try it one day!

And of course since I was in the civic district, as usual camera never left my hand... I took loads of photos and here are my favourite 3! Check them out below!!
