Do you remember storing book shelves of really thick books called encyclopedia?? Well, we don't need to waste space on them anymore... welcome to the internet version of encyclopedia: [WIKIPEDIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) We students just love wikipedia because:

1. you have information virtually about everything! Try it... say for example [Rabindranath Tagore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagore), [Netaji ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netaji)or [Abol Tabol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abol_Tabol)
2. ANybody can add in and contribute to the contents of WIkipedia
3. And unlike books, information is always changing and updating!

Wikipedia is another small, dynamic company to be watched in the future!
