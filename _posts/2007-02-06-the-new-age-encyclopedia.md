Do you remember storing book shelves of really thick books called encyclopedia??

Well, we don't need to waste space on them anymore... welcome to the internet version of encyclopedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">WIKIPEDIA</a>

We students just love wikipedia because:
<ol>
	<li>you have information virtually about everything! Try it... say for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netaji">Netaji </a>or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abol_Tabol">Abol Tabol</a></li>
	<li>ANybody can add in and contribute to the contents of WIkipedia</li>
	<li>And unlike books, information is always changing and updating!</li>
</ol>
Wikipedia is another small, dynamic company to be watched in the future!
