**3 exam pieces   (90 marks)**

- Allegro by Handel
- Esquisse by Gliere
- For Johnny Mehegan by Bernstein (least prepared)

**Scales + Arpeggios  (21 marks)**

Ok this one just on the metronome and practise practise practise

**Sight Reading (21 marks)**

I know i'll fail this... just aim to have a good fail (almost pass)

**Aural  (18 marks)**

... totally scared. Does anybody have Grade 7 Aural book with CD and can lend me? . . Cold fingers, nervous fingers, sore throat... i'm getting all jittery even after 7 music exams in my life....
