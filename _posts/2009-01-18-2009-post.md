<p style="text-align: justify; ">Has it been so long since i last penned down my thought right here?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Oh my gosh!!! it's already into the year 2009.Â And did I ever have any better way of welcoming a New Year?? Nope, absolutely never! Right under the stars, amidst the complete dark i said good bye to 2008!</p>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-419" title="new_year_2009_89437fuh8iuefjhuw" src="/img/new_year_2009_89437fuh8iuefjhuw.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="408" />
<p style="text-align: justify; ">2008 - my best year of my life as of yet. It's been an incredible journey for me and i have never been <a href="/sudden-realisation/">happier</a>!! I spent one quater of the year in Europe, <a href="/i-like-to-run-away/">travelling so much</a> across 5 countries and I also brought my <a href="/hopping-around-again/">dear parents</a> there. Work has been great and I also managed to sit for <a href="http://www.mba.com/mba/thegmat/">an exam</a>. Yes, i am waaaay happier with my adult work life than <a href="/indifference/">my student life</a>. But most importantly in 2008, i finally found something that i was searching for my entire life :D And i cannot simply look forward to more in the coming year 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Life's been changing too fast and i simply cannot afford to not pen down my thoughts right here. So i have only one resolution for this year: <strong><span style="color: #800000;">Blog Sweska! Blog!</span></strong></p>
