Last weekend i dashed for that view of those [Dutch windmills](http://www.zaanseschans.nl/) over at Holland... erm erm erm.... it's just so picturesque. Remember those childhood picture books we used to read? Yes!! I saw exactly that view. If you are ever in Amsterdam, you must surely drop by to see these windmills in the Dutch countryside which is [only 20 minutes by train](http://www.zaanseschans.nl/)... i wanna go there again, in a months' time. Once is surely not enough :D
