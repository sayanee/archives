<strong> Some extracts</strong>:

They are transactional flaws performed by one person against other. They are:
<ol>
	<li>Wining too much</li>
	<li>Adding too much value – the overwhelming desire to add our 2 cents to every discussion</li>
	<li>passing judgement</li>
	<li>Making destructive comments</li>
	<li>Starting with ‘no’, ‘but’ or ‘however’</li>
	<li>telling the world how smart we are</li>
	<li>speaking when angry – using emotional volatility as a management tool</li>
	<li>negativity</li>
	<li>withholding information – refusal to share information in order to maintain an advantage over others</li>
	<li>failing to give proper recognition</li>
	<li>claiming credit that we don’t deserve</li>
	<li>making excuses</li>
	<li>clinging to the past</li>
	<li>playing favourites</li>
	<li>refusing to express regret – the inability to take responsibility for our actions, admit we’re wrong</li>
	<li>not listening</li>
	<li>failing to express gratitude</li>
	<li>punishing the messenger – the misguided need to attack the innocent who are usually only trying to help us</li>
	<li>passing the buck – the need to blame everyone but ourselves</li>
	<li>an excessive need to be ‘me’</li>
</ol>
