[How I judge investors](http://www.metamorphblog.com/2010/03/how-i-judge-investors-.html)... And this works even when you are looking for a mentor or even writing down the qualities of your next envisioned boss.
1. Intelligence
2. Security & Self-Confidence
3. Reverence for the Entrepreneur
4. Humility & Self-knowledge
5. Does he understand what it means to be an operator?
6. Does he want me to lie to him?
7. Does he teach me things?
8. Is he a happy person?
