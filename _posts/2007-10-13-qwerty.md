so our keyboard's alphabets are laid out in a weird _qwerty_ arrangement instead of being alphabetical... but why?? [QWERTY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) is the design of the keyboard and its name comes from the first 6 letters... and it was patented as early as 1860.Â  and why?

> ... splitting up keys for letters commonly used together to speed up typing by preventing common pairs of typebars from striking the platen at the same time and sticking together.

in fact, there's another type of keyboard too - [Dvorak layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard)!
