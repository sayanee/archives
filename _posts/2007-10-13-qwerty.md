so our keyboard's alphabets are laid out in a weird <em>qwerty</em> arrangement instead of being alphabetical... but why?? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY">QWERTY</a> is the design of the keyboard and its name comes from the first 6 letters... and it was patented as early as 1860.Â  and why?
<blockquote>... splitting up keys for letters commonly used together to speed up typing by preventing common pairs of typebars from striking the platen at the same time and sticking together.</blockquote>

in fact, there's another type of keyboard too - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak layout</a>!
