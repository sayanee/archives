I have been dabbling with how to manage domain, space, ftp blah blah as a newbie of course. And cPanel is the norm it seems.

[cPanel ](http://www.cpanel.net/index.html)("Control Panel") is a graphical web-based web-hosting control panel, designed to make administration of websites easy ( [Wiki source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPanel)). it is being used by many commercial web-hosting companies and i believe it has become the standard. It deals with some common tasks such as ftp management, emails, storage and etc.
