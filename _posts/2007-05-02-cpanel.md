<p align="justify">I have been dabbling with how to manage domain, space, ftp blah blah as a newbie of course. And cPanel is the norm it seems.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://www.cpanel.net/index.html">cPanel </a>("Control Panel") is a graphical web-based web-hosting control panel, designed to make administration of websites easy (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPanel">Wiki source</a>). it is being used by many commercial web-hosting companies and i believe it has become the standard. It deals with some common tasks such as ftp management, emails, storage and etc.</p>
