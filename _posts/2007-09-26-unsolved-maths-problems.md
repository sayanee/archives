I thought this [list in Wiki ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolved_problems_in_mathematics)is rather interesting... it has the list of unsolved problems in mathematics and some problems include...

- [Goldbach's conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture "Goldbach's conjecture")
- infinitely many [Fibonacci primes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_prime "Fibonacci prime")
- [Twin prime conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime_conjecture "Twin prime conjecture")
- existence of [odd perfect numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers "Perfect number")
- infinitely many [prime quadruplets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_quadruplet "Prime quadruplet")

some of these are really easy to understand especially the ones under number theory, but nobody has been able to prove them!
