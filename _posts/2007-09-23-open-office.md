I was trying out the [Open Office ](http://www.openoffice.org/)softwares. It basically consists of...

1. [Writer ](http://www.openoffice.org/product/writer.html)is basically a word processor like MS Word
2. [Impress ](http://www.openoffice.org/product/impress.html)can be used for multimedia presentations like MS Powerpoint
3. [Calc ](http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html)is Spreadsheet programn like MS Excel
4. [Draw ](http://www.openoffice.org/product/draw.html)is a graphics manipulation program
5. [Base ](http://www.openoffice.org/product/base.html)is for manipulating databases

A future substitute for MS office in the future??
