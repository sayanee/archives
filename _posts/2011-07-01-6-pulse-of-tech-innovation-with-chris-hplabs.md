A big thanks to [Justin](https://twitter.com/#!/triplez82) for connecting me with Chris Whitney, the managing director of [HP Labs Singapore](http://www.hpl.hp.com/singapore/). We had a good laugh and chat while talking about Chris' journey in the world of technological innovations. Now you would have thought the chat would be all about algorithms, hard science and complicated machines - instead Chris emphasizes technology as an enabler for human tasks everyday, seamlessly instegration it in all aspects of our lives!

Listen up ;-)
