<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Appositives</strong></span> are nouns or a group of words used often with modifiers. An <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">appositive phrase</span></strong> usually follows the word it explains or identifies, but it may also precede it.

E.g. My cat, <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>a fluffy white little kitten</strong></span>, is really naughty today
E.g. <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>An advocate of feminism</strong></span>, Carla didn't want to hear any of his weird views.
