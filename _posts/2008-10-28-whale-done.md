The ABC's of Performance:

- B =  Behaviour, The performance that occurs
- C = Consequences, Your response to the performance

Redirection of responses...

- describe the error or problem as soon as possible, clearly and without blame
- show its negative impact
- if appropraite, take the blame for not making the task clear
- Go over the task in detail and make sure it is clearly understood
- express your continuing trust and confidence in the person

never assume you know what motivates a person
