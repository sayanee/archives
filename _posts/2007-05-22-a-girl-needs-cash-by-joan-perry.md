3 guideposts to financial successes:
<ol>
	<li>spend less than you earn</li>

</ol>
the white knight myth...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">while i was busy bathing myself in fairy dust and listening to my Prince Charming croon his words of love, I missed out on nurturing my soul. I also lost some self-esteem and the opportunity to grow because i didn't accept responsibility for a major part of my life. The woman who is totally dependant on a man when it comes to money, and ignorant of her financial life, is compromising true love and paralysing herself in the process.</p>

What truly gives you pleasure...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">As you examine your spending habits, the operative wealth building question is:'What's really going to add joy, peace and tranquility to my life, not just at the moment but down the road?' The trick is to keep what gives you true pleasure and enhances your being, but spare back what gives you only a false sense of <strong>status</strong>. And lean to enjoy the possessions and activities that add a little spring to your stride for what they are and not for any <strong>prestige</strong> that may be attached to them. When this positive approach, you'll free up yourself from the grip of <strong>consumerism</strong> and take charge of your financial life.</p>

Stock...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Stock represents a share of ownership in a company. Normally, a stock is traded on one of the following exchanges: NYSE, ASE, NASDAQ, PSE, OTC. ... ... ...  Since a share of stock represents part ownership of a company, the prices of stock shares rise and fall depending on the earnings picture for the company.</p>

Mutual Fund...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Mutual fund is a collection of stocks chosen by a fund manager who has developed a skill at buying and selling stocks. Mutual fund allows you to invest in the stock market without having to make individual buy-and-sell decisions; the fund manager does that for you. ... ... ... Mutual funds are the best way for a beginning investor to tap into opportunities offered by the stock market.... ...  With a mutual fund, you'll be more secure. After all, the fund is composed of many stocks that each perform differently. Some of the stocks will do better than others, but overall, the fund's objective is to increase in value and grow your investment. ... ....  This chance to invest in many stocks, not just one, diversifies the dollars that you invest and in one of the major advantages of mutual fund.</p>

</ol>
