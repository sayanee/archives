<strong> Some extracts:</strong>

Santa Claus and miracles in religion...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Santa Claus was a particularcustom we celebrated in our family, and it wasn't very serious. But the miracles I was hearing about were connected with real things: there as the temple, where people would go every week; there was the Sunday school, where rabbis taught the children about miracles; it was much more of a dramatic thing. Santa Claus didn't involve big institutions like the temple, which I knew was real.</p>
</blockquote>
About English...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I was terrible in English. I couldn't stand the subject. It seemed to me ridiculous to worry about whether you spelled something wrong or not, because English spelling is just a human invention - it has nothing to do with anything <em>real</em>, anything from the nature. Any word can be spelled just as well a different way. I was impatient with all this English stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
about dieing and the human spirit...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">It's hard to explain. If a Martian (who we'll imagine never dies expect by accident) came to earth and saw this peculiar race of creatures - these humans who live about 70 or 80 years, knowing that death is going to come - it would look to him a terrible problem of psychology to live under those circumstances, knowing that life is only temporary. Well, we humans somehow figure out how to live despite this problem: we laugh, we joke, we live.</p>
</blockquote>
about seeing the real part of a city...
<blockquote>The driver started right off to go up and see some palace saying, "I'll show you all the fancy places."

I said, "No thank you; That's similar in every city. I want to see the bottom part of the city where the poor people live...."</blockquote>
about public enquiry when he was involved in the Challenger space shuttle disaster...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The main thing learned at that meeting was how inefficient a public inquiry is: most of the time, other people are asking questions you already know the answer to - or are not interested in 0 you get so fogged out that your're hardly listening  when important points are being passed over.</p>
</blockquote>
on bureaucratic and safety challenges faced during the public commission for the Challenger...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The foreman, Mr. Fichtel, said he wrote a memo with this suggestion to his superiors 2 years ago, but nothing had happened yet. When he asked why, he was told the suggestion was too expensive.</p>
"Too expensive to just 4 little lines?" I said in disbelief.
<p align="justify">They all laughed. "It's not the paint; it's the paperwork," Mr. Fitchel said. "They would have to revise all the manuals".</p>
