Falling in love with [RTM ](http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember.html)and GTD!! And [there's this article](http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember.html), that explains perfectly how we can merge them both!

-  
- Create Lists for Personal and Work Daily Tasks
- Create a List for Each Project
- Brainstorm Project Tasks and Tag your Next Actions with “na”
- Use Tags and Locations to Create Contexts (@Home, @Work, @Web, etc.)
- Create Smart Lists to Separate Tasks Into Specific Contexts
- Waiting-For and Someday/Maybe Lists
