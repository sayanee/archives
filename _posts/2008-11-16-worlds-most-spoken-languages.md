I went through a few list and these 10 languages kep coming up as the 10 most spoken languages in the world...

1. Chinese
2. English
3. Spanish
4. Hindi
5. Arabic
6. Bengali 
7. Russia
8. French 
9. Japanese 
10. German 

I know 4 languages and it's funny how they are all within these 10: English, Bengali (really?), Hindi and French. And one day i know i'll also learn 2 more within this list: German and Chinese!
