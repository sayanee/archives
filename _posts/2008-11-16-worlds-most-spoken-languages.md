	<li>Chinese</li>
	<li>English</li>
	<li>Spanish <span> </span></li>
	<li>Hindi <span> </span></li>
	<li>Arabic <span> </span></li>
	<li>Bengali </li>
	<li>Russia<span> </span></li>
	<li>French </li>
	<li>Japanese </li>
	<li>German </li>

I know 4 languages and it's funny how they are all within these 10: English, Bengali (really?), Hindi and French. And one day i know i'll also learn 2 more within this list: German and Chinese!
