Is it really already July? Yes, it is almost and i'm still left with my adventures... just a little more than a week before I head home for a newer adventure. As we all begin with the next half of the year, I leave you with [one of my fav artists, Valentina](http://valentinaramos.blogspot.com/2010/06/you-can-win-2-of-my-prints.html)... Cheers from the lovely Florence :)
