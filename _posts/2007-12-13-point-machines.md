Wondered how the trains make a turn on the rail lines? Sometimes they can go straight or they can turn left or right. This is done via the [point machine ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_switch)which move the actual rail tracks and detours the running train. Yes the parts of the switch actually moves to make the way for the moving train. This movements can be done manually and now automatically! I thought this [animated gif ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Railroad_switch_animation.gif)picture showed this concept really well.
