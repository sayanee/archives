<p align="justify">And so i got <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweska/558920045/#comment72157600465653945">a comments on one of my photos </a>that it got a Lomo feel. I kinda created an <em>effect</em> without even knowing i did ;) And so i decided to find out what is this Lomo effect or rather Lomography!</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomo">Lomo</a> stands for <strong>L</strong>eningradskoye <strong>O</strong>ptiko-<strong>M</strong>echanichesckoye <strong>O</strong>byedinenie (Leningrad Optical Mechanical Union) and it is an advanced optical manufacturer in St. Petersburg, Russia. And for the photos the<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/lomo/"> BBC site states</a> 'The resulting snaps were often odd to look at, out of focus and, due to the character of the Lomo lens, garishly coloured. But they were wonderfully fresh.'</p>
<p align="justify">and here are some other link related to the Lomo effect...</p>
