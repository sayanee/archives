title: the Lomo feel
---

And so i got [a comments on one of my photos ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweska/558920045/#comment72157600465653945)that it got a Lomo feel. I kinda created an _effect_ without even knowing i did ;) And so i decided to find out what is this Lomo effect or rather Lomography!

[Lomo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomo) stands for **L**eningradskoye **O**ptiko-**M**echanichesckoye **O**byedinenie (Leningrad Optical Mechanical Union) and it is an advanced optical manufacturer in St. Petersburg, Russia. And for the photos the [ BBC site states](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/lomo/) 'The resulting snaps were often odd to look at, out of focus and, due to the character of the Lomo lens, garishly coloured. But they were wonderfully fresh.'

and here are some other link related to the Lomo effect...
