The <a class="vt-p" href="/definitions-of-i/">minimalist within me</a> will once in a while ditch all the features and find only space.

<a class="vt-p" href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">Ommwriter </a> is the perfect space i have found. It is <em>only</em> for writing with soothing backgrounds and music. Aaaahhh...I love it!
