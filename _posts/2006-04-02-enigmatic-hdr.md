HDR aka High Dynamic Range photogtaphy.

You take a few multi-exposure photos and superimpose them. The result?? An abstract, intricate and beautiful piece of art. Because it super-imposes photos from all exposures, the details are very beautifully and accurately preserved.

So can my simple simple digital camera do it? NO! Uh… I need to wait for a Digital SLR… until then I can enjoy it all over [**here**](http://flickr.com/groups/hdr/)!
