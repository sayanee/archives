<strong>My Comments:</strong> Great book.. clear and concise.
<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

so getting a huge sum of money the next day will make us rich?
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The vast majority of people simply do not have the internal capacity to create and hold on to large amounts of money and the increased challenge that go with more money and success. That, my friends, is the primary reason they don't have money. A perfect example is <strong>lottery winners</strong>. Research has shown again and again that regardless of size of their winnings, most lottery winners eventually return to their original financial state, the amount they can comfortably live with. On the other hand, the opposite occurs for self-made millionaires. Notice that when <strong>self-made millionaires</strong> lose their money, they usually have it back within a relatively short period of time. Donald Trump, is a good example.</p>

<p align="justify">money for..</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Some people like crazy because 'you could easily loose all your money, so you might as well enjoy while you can.' Others go the opposite route: they hoard their money and 'save for a <strong>rainy day</strong>.'
A word of wisdom: Saving for a rainy day might sound like a good idea, but it can create big problems. One of the principles we teach in another of our courses is the power of intention. If you are saving money for a rainy day, what are you going to get? Rainy days! Stop doing that! Instead of saving for a rainy day, focus on saving for a joyous day or for the day you win your <strong>financial freedom</strong>. Then, by virtue of the law of intention, that's exactly what you will get.</blockquote>
