Merry Christmas friends!!

I caught this white Christmas decoration at Novena Square today morning while coming back from gym. So i thought of capturing it right here. Christmas never fails to remind me of all the Christmas trees i used to decorate and all the nativity plays of my childhood.

Oh! the year is almost ending.. hold on and 2010 will be here soon! :D
