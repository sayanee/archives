Â Socrates. Statement at trial condemning him to death, 399BC, Athens.

I need to read this. It is a puzzling even till today as to why a Greek society which was democratic would sentence a 70 year old philospher to death and that philosopher had been teaching for life. One excerpt from his speech...
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I spend all my time going about trying to persuade you, young and old, to make your first and chief concern not for your bodies nor for your possessions, but for the highest welfare of your souls, proclaiming as I go, Wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing, both to the individual and to the state</p>
