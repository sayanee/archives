<p align="justify"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_and_Grow_Rich">Think and Grow Rich</a> - A great book. It was written in 1937 just at the end of the Great Depression. I liked it and if you wanna read it for free, just <a href="http://www.zilliontech.com/knowledge/thinkandgrowrich.html">download the eBook</a> or <a href="http://think-and-grow-rich-book.blogspot.com/">read from a blog </a>or <a href="http://www.absolute1.net/napoleon-hill-think-and-grow-rich.html">another website</a> :D</p>
<p align="justify">Like any book that teaches us about Personal mastery, it always gives us many examples of role models. So instead of giving examples of Trump or Buffet, i read here about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison </a>(electricity), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bell">Graham Bell</a> (telephone), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi">Marconi </a>(radio) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford">Henry Ford</a> (Ford Motors). The examples were all shifted back in time and yet the principles taught were powerfully timeless!</p>
<p align="justify">i read a paragraph about the value of prayer and belief...</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The subconscious mind in the intermediary, which translates ones's prayers into terms which Infinite Intelligence can recognise, presents the message, and bring back the answer in the form of a definite plan or idea for procuring the object of the prayer. Understand this principle and you will know why mere words read from a prayer book cannot and will never serve as an agency of communication between the mind of man and Infinite Intelligence.</p>
