Narrow roads lined with little 2-storey brick houses and gardens is common here in this part of France. And it's just so pretty...  i can't wait for spring to come when the flowers and trees will finally start to bloom... bbbrrrr it's cold to walk along here in the morning. I think it's around 8 or 9 degrees in the early mornings.

And the weekend is here which nearly completes my first week at work! And i'm planning to go further north - Nord Pas de Calais region... Lille, Dunkerque, Calais... let's see what i'll be visiting and discovering ;)
