Whooppie!! I'm exploring more and more stuff with Google Earth! If you have not downloaded the [latest version 4 beta](http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html), please do because theres's more than just history and geography. I'm simply taken away by the animation and 3D capibilities of this version. Take a look at some videos like [the Eiffel Tower](http://youtube.com/watch?v=yPYQ8xJ9YV4) or this one as it flies you through NY, Grand Canyon and the Golden Gate Bridge...

But I think the greatest strength of Google Earth is in its sharing capability through the use of  [kml](http://earth.google.com/kml/kml_tut.html) or kmz files with icons like this ![](http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c273/sweska/geicon.gif) . I have been addicted to these ge files in communities like  [Earth Explorer](http://explorer.altopix.com/) or the [GE Blog](http://www.gearthblog.com/).

Now i found some really interesting ones

- [Lord of the Rings shooting sites](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2005/09/middle_earth_fo.html),
- the [Tour de France routes](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2006/05/tour_de_france.html),  [Vancouver buildings](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2006/07/vancouver_in_3d.html) in 3D, the [Seven Wonders of the World](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2005/11/seven_wonders_i_1.html),
- 3D models of  [Giza Pyramid](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2006/05/great_pyramid_o.html) or [Eiffel Tower](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2006/01/high_resolution.html),
- a beautiful yearly  [time animation of the Earth's look](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2006/11/blue_marble_time_ani.html) as seasons change, even a [Planet Mars' ](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2006/03/user_develops_m.html)overlay landscape and [plate techtonic shifting animation ](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Cat/0/Number/643492)since 600 million years!!

...Oh! There are just too many of them. You have to really explore them all by yourself :D
