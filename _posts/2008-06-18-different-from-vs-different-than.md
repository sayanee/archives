So when should we use 'different from' and 'different than' ? **different from** is used to compare 2 nouns. E.g. The curtains in this room are different from the ones in my room. **different than** is often used in American English to compare a noun and a clause. E.g. Elaine's painting was veyr different than i has expected! Some related links:
