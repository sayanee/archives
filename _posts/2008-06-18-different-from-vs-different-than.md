So when should we use 'different from' and 'different than' ?

<strong>different from</strong> is used to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">compare 2 nouns</span>. E.g. The curtains in this room are different from the ones in my room.

<strong>different than</strong> is often used in American English to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">compare a noun and a clause</span>. E.g. Elaine's painting was veyr different than i has expected!
