How was your long weekend? Mine was spend at pretty high places and the [Design Festival](http://www.singaporedesignfestival.com/designfest09/)! The clouds were amazing and some photos will definitely go into experimentation and eventually into the [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweska) :P

As for the rest of week... I'm looking forward to the business case workshop in school, system assurance sessions at work and a lot stuff to do!!!!!! :D it's merely Monday! Have a great week - from the top of the flyer! ![](/img/flyer.jpg)
