I was using one little gadget this time... a handheld device to measure the distance from where you are standing to where the laser pointer is placed! So say you point the laser to a faraway building, it give you the distance measured! Some brands include...

2. [trimble](http://www.trimble.com/hd150.shtml)
3. [disto](http://www.apache-laser.com/product/distance.htm)

now who needs a measuring tape! :P
