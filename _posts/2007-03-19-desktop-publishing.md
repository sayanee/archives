I learnt a new word phrase - [Desktop Publishing (DTP). ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing)It means to create and design publication documents on our own in personal computers for large scale or small scale printing. I never knew there was actually another area of designing just for personal publishing!

while surfing and reading i found some feature of deskptop publishing:

- typography
- page layouts
- fonts
- pre-press production
- punctuation
- alignment
- design

and some softwares that can help us do just that!
- QuarkXPress
- Adobe InDesign
- Scribus
- Microsoft Publisher
- Apple Pages
- Pagemaker
