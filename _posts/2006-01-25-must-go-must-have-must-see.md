<p align="justify">I should really blog more frequently because I have a lot of things to say, but I just get too lazy to say it all because as you know I always want my blog to be colourful with pics! This blog shall be about my 3 recently discovered loves... <font color="#0000cc">Must Go</font> <font color="#660066">Must have </font><font color="#669900">Must See</font></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#330099">Must Go..Bras Basah Complex</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify">I'm in love with this shopping centre. Looks shabby from the exterior, but when you step in and explore the interior shops, I was enthralled to find a <strong>treasure trove</strong> of books, arts and crafts stuff. It has a rustic and old charm in it...Look out for these special shops that really intrigued me.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="/img/bbc2.jpg" /></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Basheer Graphic Books</strong> Books on arts, design, modeling, crafts, drawings, fashion and more. This book about packaging really struck my eyes...wish I could buy it! And there was also a book about pop ups!!! So cool to make cards with popping up stuff inside it!! All these arts and crafts brought me back to the time when we were Sec 2 art and of course Ms. Kong...ooppppzz. Eh I was actually pretty good in art and crafts. My drawings got displayed 2 times<em>...**ahem ahem**</em> I'm not boasting...check out one of my drawings!</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Arts Friend</strong> Every Arts' lovers material corner. You want it... you can find them all here from Styrofoam, to ribbons, to acrylic to various types of paints. There’s a branch on the 4th floor of Ngee Ann too!</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Knowledge Books Store</strong> A book store that sells 2nd hand stuff... and wow what a collection! From classics, to SAT books (i know they are useless to me now), magazines... talking about magazines. Don't waste time and $$$$ buying Her world or FHM and similar periodicals. Wait for a few months and buy them for 1 buck. I had this crazy idea of buying 10 FHM for my guy frens...Hehe!</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#000099">Must Have.. My 80GB Hard Disk</font></strong></p>

<p align="justify">I carry it with me every time and if there’s fire I’ll run out with this one! It can fit within the palm of my hand and yet it has infinitely precious stuff –
1. 7.27 GB <strong>Memories</strong> of scanned photographs + drawings + letters + recorded childhood voices as old as 1910s to as new as today!
2. 4.89 GB of precious <strong>Music</strong> collections of English + Hindi basically
3. Who needs to keep lecture notes when I can store them all!! And of course my precious projects!
<p align="justify">I salute technology once again. It has allowed me to <strong>hold infinity in the palm of hand</strong>. You too can hold infinity in the palm of your hands.... do it!</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#996633">Must See... Parineeta</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify">It is a Bollywood movie ...speaking about <strong>Bollywood</strong> I think one day I really need to educate Sweska Says’ readers about Bollywood! But never mind that’s a blog for another day. Until then <strong>lesson one</strong>: Bollywood movies are basically Hindi language movies and they are called Bollywood because the film industry is based in Mumbai which was formerly known as Bombay – thus the name!! Obviously, Indians have fondly named it after Hollywood.</p>

<p align="justify">I saw Pareenita during the hols and it came to my mind once again because today I finally got the song...<em>Piyu Bole</em>. It’s really nice. I can associate a lot with Parineeta because it has the <font color="#660066"><em>Howrah Bridge</em> </font>that I used to see from my roof terrace, it has the Goddess that I last saw in the hearts of the <em><font color="#336633">Pandals</font></em> when I was 11, it has the tinkling trams, it has Tagore’s songs, it has <em><font color="#660099">phucchkas</font></em>, it has the <em><font color="#993333">luchis</font></em>, it has the big pillared houses, it has the black pine wood furniture, it has Darjeeling and lastly it has Shekhar and Lolitha with their story of hesitance, reluctance, ego and silence.</p>
<p align="justify">I’m eagerly waiting for a letter from the city of Shekhar and Lolitha...will tell you all as soon as I get it!</p>
