Brugge, the Venice of the north is tucked in a little egg shaped corner of Belgium. It is only 2km by 3km in dimension and it can be covered well by walking... with a little help from a [good map ](http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/cosic/eurocrypt2000/old/map_bruges_web.gif)and some [walking route advice](http://www.brugge.be/internet/en/toerisme/sightseeing/wandelroutes/index.htm). This is my walking route... enjoy! Especially along the Djiver, Burg and the Markt and Minnewater...
