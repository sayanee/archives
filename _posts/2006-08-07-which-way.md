<p align="justify">So within a span of 3 or 4 days i just decided my modules and final year project... kind of written my direction for the next one year. I'm kinda freaking out now after merely browsing through the lecture notes of next semester's modules... telecommunication, wireless, entropy, a whole bunch of theorem names after so posh sounding people. I'm freaking out... i was screaming at ridz over the MSN. My gang of friends are taking totally different stuff and FYP is also all by myself. All by myself!! Guess i just gotta survive it somehow for the next one year. All is so uncertain this next year.</p>
<p align="justify">And beyond that?? I'm totally blank and so i have reached the quarter life crises like they all say. Never in my life was i so unclear about what i would do for the next 2 years. After primary school... oh i'm going secondary school... then JC, then university. It was all planned and lined up. And so what happens after this one year?? I do not know...</p>
<p align="justify">And like i once posted a comment on a certain stranger's blog end last year... i quoted him a saying from Lewis Caroll's Alice in Wonderland.</p>

<blockquote>Alice came to a fork in the road. "Which road do I take?" she asked.
"Where do you want to go?" responded the Cheshire cat.
"I don't know," Alice answered.
"Then," said the cat, "it doesn't matter."</blockquote>

<p align="justify">Dad took this photo during one of his evening walks and of course i did the post processing and immediately i got reminded of <a target="_blank" href="http://ww.thinkexist.com/quotes/lewis_carroll/" title="Quotations by Lewis Caroll">Caroll and his much loved quotations</a>. This pic is about exactly what i'm feeling now. And so I shall go where my life takes me... i have a really long journey ahead... dunno what chances will strike me where and when and why. I guess i'll figure out somehow along the way.</p>
And hope you all do too and <em>you</em> too.
