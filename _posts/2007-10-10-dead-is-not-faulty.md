when DEAD is something else...

<strong>Me:</strong> Simon!! The point was faulty and was not tested… the last teeth calibration number showed DEAD.
<strong>Simon:</strong> No way! It was tested… all the values are there
<strong>Me:</strong> Yes I’m looking at the real-time frames!… it shows DEAD
<strong>Simon:</strong> Sweska!!!!!! It’s D E A D… <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal number</a>!
<strong>Me:</strong> Oh …..*silence*
<strong>Simon:</strong> Hello?? Hahahhahah it’s D E A D!
<strong>Me:</strong> Yes ... Opppss thanks!

Ok so now I know, the other meaning of DEAD is 57,005 and of all numbers it had to be this number??? :P
