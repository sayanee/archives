title: dead is not faulty
---

when DEAD is something else... **Me:** Simon!! The point was faulty and was not tested… the last teeth calibration number showed DEAD. **Simon:** No way! It was tested… all the values are there **Me:** Yes I’m looking at the real-time frames!… it shows DEAD **Simon:** Sweska!!!!!! It’s D E A D… [hexadecimal number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)! **Me:** Oh …..\*silence\* **Simon:** Hello?? Hahahhahah it’s D E A D! **Me:** Yes ... Opppss thanks! Ok so now I know, the other meaning of DEAD is 57,005 and of all numbers it had to be this number??? :P
