\*throws confetti\*

\*screams out loud\*

\*punches in the air\*

jumps up and down.... ouch!!!!!!!!!!... this hurt!!!

but whatever.... yes i made it. I can finally move on and look forward to the next stage of my life. Can't wait for things that will be coming my way!!! It was a nerve racking wait for the result... but it's all in place now.... phew... it wasn't an easy past 2 years for me... but it has all turned out to be just so nice!!

Thank you all my friends and my parents... shan't look back anymore... time to really move on... thanks for this chance!
