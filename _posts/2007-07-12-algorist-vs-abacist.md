For centuries the dispute between the algorithmic and the abacist system went on and then finally in the 18th century, the abacist system was totally disappeared!

<p align="left">This picture depicts that dispute.</p>
<p align="justify">This woodcut from the <em>Margarita Philosophica</em> of Gregorius Reisch, published in Freiburg 1503, shows "Arithmetica" watching a competition between an "abacist" and an "algorist". Judging from the clothes of the two competitors, the abacist is a monk and the algorist a worldly scholar. Arithmetica appears to favour the algorist; her own clothes are covered in Indian numerals, and she looks approvingly at the algorist's progress</p>
