<blockquote>There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers.
~ Richard Feynman</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It used to be that only astronomical numbers were huge. The financial number have caught up and now we do see number in <span style="color: #008080;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">trillions</span></strong></span>. And not surprisingly, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8552410.stm">internet number are also catching up</a> in <strong><span style="color: #800000;">millions</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #993366;">billions</span></strong>...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-768" title="visualise-internet" src="/img/visualise-internet.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/billion-app-countdown/">iTunes</a> had 1 billion apps downloaded last year. Just recently, all in the month of July 2010, <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/07/20/foursquare-100-million-checkins/">Foursquare</a> had 100 million check-ins, <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/100-million/">Wordpress</a> had 100 million plugin downloads, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/21/netflix-users/">Netflix</a> had 15 million users and <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=409753352130">Facebook</a> reached 500 million users. 500 million users is a huge number... granted there can be many duplicates, even 400 million is a huge number.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, any guesses when is the next time a web app will reach 1 billion user base? With such a fast penetration of the internet, I hope more people will be able to access it cheaper in the coming years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would say 2015... 5 more years for a web app to reach 1 billion user base. What do you say?</p>
