> There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers. ~ Richard Feynman

It used to be that only astronomical numbers were huge. The financial number have caught up and now we do see number in **trillions**. And not surprisingly, the [internet number are also catching up](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8552410.stm) in **millions** and **billions**...

[iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/billion-app-countdown/) had 1 billion apps downloaded last year. Just recently, all in the month of July 2010,  [Foursquare](http://mashable.com/2010/07/20/foursquare-100-million-checkins/) had 100 million check-ins, [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/100-million/) had 100 million plugin downloads, [Netflix](http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/21/netflix-users/) had 15 million users and [Facebook](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=409753352130) reached 500 million users. 500 million users is a huge number... granted there can be many duplicates, even 400 million is a huge number.

So, any guesses when is the next time a web app will reach 1 billion user base? With such a fast penetration of the internet, I hope more people will be able to access it cheaper in the coming years.

I would say 2015... 5 more years for a web app to reach 1 billion user base. What do you say?
