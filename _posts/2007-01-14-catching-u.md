Some precious catching up!!

in the beginning of the year 2007, there were really some precious catching up...

First, with cousins... my crazy cousins in Kolkata, India. Wheeeheee!!! How we have indeed grown... and now most of u are even getting married or are eligible bachelors!!

Next, my dear dear JC classmates from 11/01. We are as lame as ever, but somehow we have toned down?!?! And interestingly our topic of conversation was about love, jobs and the uncertain future. Erm... may i reveal that ogh has a time target to get married within the next 4 years. And i wonder who'll be the first one in our class to get married?? With every meet up, it just gets lesser and lesser of us... but it's ok. I have found the importance of having few friends... but few really good friends nevertheless.

And finally, i just returned from meeting with fenelia... that gal always never fails to contact us whenever she's back in Singapore!! Just missing in the equation was kit!! Oh sigh... how we miss bullying kit... or even dressing up as models... cheapo models in the dressing rooms of Mango or Zara. And also there's sulo, xuan, kurien...

I guess now we are all in the midstÂ of a major change... from uni to job. All the best guys :D and continue to be in touch!!
