If you know the internet, you must know the term [Web 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2)!! Web 2.0 basically means web-based applications. Some examples are:

- [Flickr](http://flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/) - web based photo management system
- [Meebo](http://wwwl.meebo.com/index-en.html) - web based MSN/yahoo messenger type application
- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) - Encyclopedia
- [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) - adding internet bookmarks
- [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/) - social interaction online
- [YouTube](http://youtube.com/) - videos
- [Digg](http://digg.com/) - internet news
- [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) - Voice Chat software
- [eBay](http://www.ebay.com.sg/) - internet shopping / selling

Basically, in all of them you can do things previously you did offline (no internet). All of these applications allows you to open a freeÂ account and interact with other users. Try them!!
