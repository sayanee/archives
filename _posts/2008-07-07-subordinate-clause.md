Structure of a sentence with a subordinate clause goes like this:

Subordinate conjunction/Relative pronoun +Subordinate clause, Main Clause

E.g. Although it was raining, we went out to reach the station on time

[**Subordinate clause**](http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/subordinateclause.htm) does not form a complete sentence and hence it will start the sentence with **Subordinate conjunctions **or **Relative pronouns**

Subordinate conjunctions: after, although, as, because, before, even if, even though, if, in order that once, provided that, rather than, since, so, that, than, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, whether, while, why

Relative Pronouns: that, which, whichever, who, whoever, whom, whose, whosever, whomever
