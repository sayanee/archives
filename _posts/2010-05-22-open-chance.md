I have been too quiet when so much has been happening in my life for the past 3 months!

For the past year, I have been heavily exposed to so many groups that were open and welcoming in many projects and ideas. I have been inspired to know that many of these are being headed by younger people who have dared to go beyond the safety net of a secured life. Words like entrepreneurship, innovation and change are not just words, but I have actually met people who did them!

As for me, I'm in the most crazy part of my life, and I know it'll only get crazier ;) Who knew of all place, I would be in Ljubljana meeting young people and learning from their talents and skills! In the coming months, I hope to travel around and experience more!

Before I come back sooner... I wish to give my heartfelt thanks to these bunch of people. Thank you for inspiring me!
