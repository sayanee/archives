<p align="justify">It’s really not easy to work in a team and most of the time we have the tendency to meet slacker group mates. But i guess i was really lucky! We all have our different personalities, perceptions and expectations. Yet, we embraced them and every time we did it really well. To all my project mates... a big thank you!!</p>
<p align="justify">I'll keep these memories wrapped up safely in an envelope for years to come...</p>
