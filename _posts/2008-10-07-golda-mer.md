[Golda Meir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir) was the 4th Prime Minister of Israel and she held her office from 1969 to 1974.

Some of her famous quotes includes...

> On 10 May 1948, four days before the official establishment of the state, Meir traveled to Amman disguised as an Arab woman for a secret meeting with King Abdullah of Transjordan at which she urged him not to join the other Arab countries in attacking the Jews. Abdullah asked her not to hurry to proclaim a state. Golda, known for her acerbic wit, replied: "We've been waiting for 2,000 years. Is that hurrying?"

> The Muslims can fight and lose, then come back and fight again. But Israel can only lose once.
