<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

I thought CD 2: becoming a best selling author was really different from anything i have heard. And here are some examples of sites and authors given which can be helpful:
<ol>
	<li>eBay</li>
	<li>Amazon.com</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.alibris.com/">Alibris</a>--&gt; they print on demand</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Gutenberg</a></li>
	<li>Everything men know about Women by Dr. Alan Francis -- this is a really funny one. Go check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0836208196/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-5684891-7618408#reader-link">what's inside the book</a> :P Well, it was a counter example to dispel the belief that we need to be good in language commands to write a best selling book.</li>
</ol>
A small extract from this CD:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">So to summarise this whole thing, if i could just -- so number 1 is mass appeal; no 2 is to have a good title; be willing to invest in design, layout and design; you must have a rags-to-riches story, ... .... ...  Writing syle must be simple and conversational, first person. Have a combination of practical strategies as well as emotional inspirational stuff.</p>
