> **Book Title:** Paving the way to the top (Audio Scripts) **Author:** Adam Khoo and Stuart Tan **Year written/published:** 2005 **Summary:** This contains the audio scripts of 6 CDs:

1. Success psychology, Selling and Influcence
2. Becoming a best selling Author
3. Building and running a business
4. Driving yourself to success
5. Becoming a Millionare 1
6. Becoming a Millionare 2

**Some extracts:** I thought CD 2: becoming a best selling author was really different from anything i have heard. And here are some examples of sites and authors given which can be helpful:
1. eBay
2. Amazon.com
3. [Alibris](http://www.alibris.com/)--> they print on demand
4. [Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page)
5. Everything men know about Women by Dr. Alan Francis -- this is a really funny one. Go check out [what's inside the book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0836208196/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-5684891-7618408#reader-link) :P Well, it was a counter example to dispel the belief that we need to be good in language commands to write a best selling book.

A small extract from this CD: >  

> So to summarise this whole thing, if i could just -- so number 1 is mass appeal; no 2 is to have a good title; be willing to invest in design, layout and design; you must have a rags-to-riches story, ... .... ...  Writing syle must be simple and conversational, first person. Have a combination of practical strategies as well as emotional inspirational stuff.
