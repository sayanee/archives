INTERNET!!!! I just have to sit in front of my comp and i can easily spend 5 hours on it... blogs blogs blogs, [wordpress](http://wordpress.com/forums/), [flickr](http://flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/), [youtube](http://youtube.com/), [photoshop](http://www.tutorialized.com/), flash, css, [plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins) etc etc etc. While I do learn bits and pieces I simply cannot afford to do this NOW.

I have the best exam timetable ever... notice there is a gap of 4 days between each exam and I only gotta go back for 3 days. Lovely!

Now the only thing i gotta do is... 1. Study mug mindwork 2. Workout -  guess what! i lost weight again :(  When I workout regularly i gain weight and when i don't, i loose! Weird!! 3. Play a little muzzzic

The only thing i don't wanna do is: **INTERNET. **It has become a fatal attraction for me. Ok so there i go off until 2 may!

I wanna taste this forbidden fruit called the internet only after 2nd May. So let me see how well i can resist this temptation and conquer myself. The time starts NOW!

Wish me luck!!!! :) And I almost forgot...Goodbye Blogspot!! ;)
