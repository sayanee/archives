when i woke up this morning i felt this suddenly…
<p align="justify">That out of all my years in life i’m going through my best time <em>as yet</em>. And it is even greater that i’m realising it as i’m going through it right <em>now</em> because often we only realise our best times spent when it is already over or we keep waiting for years hoping for that best time to come.</p>
