when i woke up this morning i felt this suddenly…

That out of all my years in life i’m going through my best time _as yet_. And it is even greater that i’m realising it as i’m going through it right _now_ because often we only realise our best times spent when it is already over or we keep waiting for years hoping for that best time to come.
