I read a note my Grandma wrote back in 1923 
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me 
He said, "Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago, 
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I love your Grandma so. 

We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together 
Get married in the first town we came to and live forever 
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead 
I found this letter, and this is what it said : 

"If you get there before I do 
Don't give up on me 
I'll meet you when my chores are through 
I don't know how long I'll be 

But I'm not gonna let you down 
Darling wait and see 
And between now and then 
Til I see you again 

I'll be loving you 
Love, Me." 

I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away 
In the doorway of the church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray 
I know I've never seen him cry in all my fifteen years 
But as he said these words to her, his eyes fill up with tears 

"If you get there before I do 
Don't give up on me 
I'll meet you when my chores are through 
I don't know how long I'll be 

But I'm not gonna let you down 
Darling wait and see 
And between now and then 
Til I see you again 

I'll be loving you 
Love, Me."
