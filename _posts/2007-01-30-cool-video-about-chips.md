Chips... not potato chips :P I'm talking about Silicon pieces on which integrated circuits are built.Â Anyway, i found this really cool video [from Scoble](http://scobleizer.com/2007/01/28/the-intel-video-i-should-have-linked-to-more-prominently/), about [Intel](http://www.intel.com/technology/index.htm?iid=home+hdr_nav1_technology) and the technology that is pushing for smaller and smaller devices.

Well, next time you see another smaller gadget on your hands, think chips!!
