I met someone really special yesterday and it was so \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

![](/img/so.jpg) And i was waiting for her in front of Tangs... i don't really know how she looks like now and she also doesn't really know. But guess we'll just figure out somehow!! And just as i was about to call her again, someone came from behind and gave me a huge surprise.

I turned around... and my oh my oh my!! I was just speechless for a few seconds and then I screamed. People walking past by me looked at me... but I don't care. And strangely, she herself was NOT SURPRISED at all by my reaction as she kept laughing and laughing... hahha she said remembering how i was 10 years back, it's not surprising !!!!!! Oh man !!!!!! But it's good right?? It means that i still have the heart of a 12-13 year old kid!!

Well.. of course i can explain all these excitement and exhileration because i'm seeing her in person for the first time in almost 10 years!! And after that it was as if the whole 10 years just zoom zoomed right in front of us as we told each other our stories. It's as if our friendship was renewed once again. And yet even in all these 10 years she has not changed a single bit. She's still the same pretty and demure nice good girl. Our conversations still clicked so well and we just went on and on. It's really overwhelming... how people can still stay the same after all these years. Time changes, we age and yet we ourselves don't change...

We remembered our classmates and  times we had in the Old Henderson School with only 3 other precious classmates. Haha! yeah of course that's our mother tongue class every Saturday... 1995 + 1996 was the ONLY time i actually enjoyed going to mother tongue classes. And not to forget she and cynthia were my first friends in Singapore.

Dunno when i'll see her again... but i know we'll keep in touch for a much longer time somehow in some way. Anyway i still dunno how to fill up the blanks of my first sentence.... what should the word be?? Well... maybe i should just leave it as a blank because some things can never really be expressed in words. You just have to feel it ;)
