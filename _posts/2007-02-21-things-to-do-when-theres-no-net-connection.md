i'm definitely an internet addict and sometimes when the router's not working or i'm having low connectivity, i get pissed :P

but, i found some wonderful stuff to do when the net is down... i was reading it <a href="http://commutesmarter.blogspot.com/2007/02/five-more-things-to-do-with-no-net.html">here </a>and <a href="http://speakingfreely.wordpress.com/2007/02/06/five-things-to-do-with-a-pc-when-you-have-no-internet-connection/">there</a>. And upon a slight collation, here's my list!
<ol>
	<li>organise hard disk / D drive / C drive</li>
	<li>catch up on RSS feeds</li>
	<li>categorise/delete feeds and book marks</li>
	<li>delete programs i don't use</li>
	<li>run maintenance programs</li>
	<li>clean the dust/dirt on my laptop</li>
	<li>Write down your logins and passwords for all your sites</li>
	<li>browse through photos and photoshop them for flickr uploads!</li>
	<li>listen and categorise music collection</li>
</ol>
