title: things to do when thereâ€™s no net connection
---

i'm definitely an internet addict and sometimes when the router's not working or i'm having low connectivity, i get pissed :P but, i found some wonderful stuff to do when the net is down... i was reading it [here ](http://commutesmarter.blogspot.com/2007/02/five-more-things-to-do-with-no-net.html)and [there](http://speakingfreely.wordpress.com/2007/02/06/five-things-to-do-with-a-pc-when-you-have-no-internet-connection/). And upon a slight collation, here's my list!

1. organise hard disk / D drive / C drive
2. catch up on RSS feeds
3. categorise/delete feeds and book marks
4. delete programs i don't use
5. run maintenance programs
6. clean the dust/dirt on my laptop
7. Write down your logins and passwords for all your sites
8. browse through photos and photoshop them for flickr uploads!
9. listen and categorise music collection
