**Shutter Speed** is the length of time the camera shutter is open and it is alos known as the exposure **time**.

Some factors affecting shutter speed:

1. total exposure is proportional to exposure time/light reaching the image sensor of a DSLR
2. faster shutter speed requires a larger aperture, and slower shutter speed requires a smaller aperture
