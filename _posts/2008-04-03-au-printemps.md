See these little green leaves that are coming out finally?? Yes! In less than 2 weeks' time Spring will come full bloom... and climate is becoming warmer and there are more blue skies. The nightÂ comes only at 8:30pm! Wheee i'm looking forward to Spring!! And maybe then i can fully enjoy the Keukenhof tulip gardens and the a ride along the Brugge canals...
