I just love the way Robert Frost can bring out the surface meaning as well as the menaing that is deeper within. It's just beautiful...Â 

Stopping by the woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost
<blockquote>Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
<font color="#800000">But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
</font></blockquote>
