from loic's thoughts... <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2011/01/why-i-ditched-europe-for-silicon-valley.html">Why I ditched Europe for Silicon Valley</a>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When european entrepreneurs wake up in the morning and start their startup, they generally want to dominate their city or their country, first. I have been there, done that, and succeeded in France. Yes, you can succeed building a spanish, german, british, french or whatever leader and sell it or even go public. But by the time you do this there is likely a Silicon Valley player that got bigger, more money...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">...when entrepreneurs start something in Silicon Valley, they want to lead, own and eat the world, not San Francisco or even the US. That's their vision of their success. My feeling is that european entrepreneurs don't want that, they want to first dominate London and the UK, Germany, etc. Nothing prevents them from dreaming bigger day one.</p>
