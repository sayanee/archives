---

I thought [this article was really good ](http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/how-to-conduct-your-own-annual-review/)in explaining the way we can review the past year and the year ahead of us. I especailly love the idea of keeping a list of Metrics ...

> On a separate tab of the spreadsheet, I keep up with a few general metrics from year to year, including these:

1. New Countries Visited
2. All Countries Visited
3. People on Life List
4. Major projects accomplished
5. Long-term savings
6. Income sustainability formula (months)
7. Creative Works Finished
8. Blog Readers
9. Income Streams
10. Number of Events Hosted in My Home
11. Days I talk at least 30 minutes with spouse, significant other, or children

yes i like #3 and #11... for the people who are important in our lives :D
