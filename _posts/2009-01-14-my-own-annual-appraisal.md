I thought <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/how-to-conduct-your-own-annual-review/">this article was really good </a>in explaining the way we can review the past year and the year ahead of us. I especailly love the idea of keeping a list of Metrics ...
<blockquote>On a separate tab of the spreadsheet, I keep up with a few general metrics from year to year, including these:</blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>New Countries Visited</li>
	<li>All Countries Visited</li>
	<li>People on Life List</li>
	<li>Major projects accomplished</li>
	<li>Long-term savings</li>
	<li>Income sustainability formula (months)</li>
	<li>Creative Works Finished</li>
	<li>Blog Readers</li>
	<li>Income Streams</li>
	<li>Number of Events Hosted in My Home</li>
	<li>Days I talk at least 30 minutes with spouse, significant other, or children</li>
</ol>
yes i like #3 and #11... for the people who are important in our lives :D
