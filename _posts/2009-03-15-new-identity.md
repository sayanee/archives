My new biz cards have finally arrived and i'm elated :D

I got 10 free cards from [Moo](http://www.moo.com/flickr/pro/) thanks to [my Flickr Pro account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweska/). With meeting so many people, i really needed to give out my contact cards and these mini cards are so perfect! They are carefully cropped from my photos and designed with a slick small shape. Love it!

Last week's been really magical... chances and opportunities have popped up and i can't wait to get started in all of them. And so, these Sweska contact cards will come in handy!

New identity? Nahh... i'm just being myself ;)
