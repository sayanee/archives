My new biz cards have finally arrived and i'm elated :D
<p style="text-align: justify;">I got 10 free cards from <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.moo.com/flickr/pro/">Moo</a> thanks to <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweska/">my Flickr Pro account</a>. With meeting so many people, i really needed to give out my contact cards and these mini cards are so perfect! They are carefully cropped from my photos and designed with a slick small shape. Love it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last week's been really magical... chances and opportunities have popped up and i can't wait to get started in all of them. And so, these Sweska contact cards will come in handy! New identity? Nahh... i'm just being myself ;)</p>
