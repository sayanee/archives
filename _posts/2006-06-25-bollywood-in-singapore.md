Yipppeeee!!!!! Just came back from a fabulous date – a date with mom and dad! And it was fantastic coz I was out of home for the first time in 10 days!! Dunno when was the last time I was so sick and well we watched a Bollywood movie so near our house, in J8!

We watched **Krrish** It was fantastic. And you should also watch it because...

Because it has the handsome Hrithick Roshan + pretty Priyanka Chopra (Miss World 2000) Because Krrish is a super hero who found his identity right here in Singapore.. me not joking! Because you’ll be able to see Krrish jump across the Singapore River and the OUB Plaza in a Chinese Martial arts style. Because you’ll see the hero and heroine not dance around some tree... but in the Raffles Place and Suntec City and National Library with all our very own Singaporean sky scrapers! Because you’ll be able to see Krrish run on the Orchard Road at the speed of the buses. Because Esplanade will get turned into a science research centre...haha!! Because Sentosa island will get turned into a villain’s den! But most importantly... it’s a really nice film and I enjoyed it :)

Hey get a glimpse of all the actions... can u recognise the places??
