[6 degrees of seperation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) is a theory that every person on this planet is seperated by only 6 people! Ths interesting stuff that i found is the [facebook group ](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8900080125)created by [Steve Jackson](http://www.steve-jackson.net/six_degrees/index.html). Something to think about... how are we really connected to a celebrity or are we connected to a little boy living in an isolated village in India?
