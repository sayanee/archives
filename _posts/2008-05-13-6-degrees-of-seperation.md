<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">6 degrees of seperation</a> is a theory that every person on this planet is seperated by only 6 people!

Ths interesting stuff that i found is the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8900080125">facebook group </a>created by <a href="http://www.steve-jackson.net/six_degrees/index.html">Steve Jackson</a>. Something to think about... how are we really connected to a celebrity or are we connected to a little boy living in an isolated village in India?
