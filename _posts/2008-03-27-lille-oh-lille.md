Tucked in the border of France and Belgium, there's this little town called Lille and Arnau comes from there. So naturally, i spent a weekend walking around this little charm ... check out this video!

My fav place has to be  [Bois de Boulogne](http://www.theotherside.co.uk/tm-heritage/visit/visit-lille-citadelle.htm), the little park where Arnau once played when he was young. And it has hardly changed even after 2 decades... and one thing that really cracked me up was the smaller version [Gare de Lille Flandres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Lille-Europe). Kids love this little railway station and of course there's also the little train for them to ride on. And this also includes the little kid, Arnau. Guess there's alwas a kid in us even after 20 years!!!
