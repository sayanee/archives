<strong>Summary:</strong> Various techniques for playing with our mind in imagination and on paper
<strong>My Comments:</strong>Â  it's a fun book! Especially i loved the historical examples he provided... which i quoted them below.
<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

Creativity Quotient...
<blockquote>Curiosity, Flexibility, Resourcefulness, Challenging, Trendspotting, Proactivity, Openness, Self-Belief, Vision/Goals, Intuition, Simplifying, Risk-taking</blockquote>
most of the greatest developments in our lives emerged from the minds of people who were not specialists in those disciplines...
<ul>
	<li>Wright brothers pioneers the first airplane, but they were bicycle mechanics</li>
	<li>A journalist invested the parking meter</li>
	<li>an undertaker developed the automatic telephone</li>
	<li>a television engineers developed the long-playing record</li>
	<li>a veterinarian developed pneumatic tyre</li>
	<li>a sculptor invented ballpoint pen</li>
	<li>a musician developed Kudachrome film</li>
	<li>a painter developed Morse Code</li>
</ul>
metamorphical thinking can make beautiful connections between seemingly unrelated things...
<ul>
	<li>Michael Faraday imagined electricity to be like a flowing fluid</li>
	<li>DNA molecules were pictures by Watson and Crick as a spiral staircase, able to split into 2 rungs and reconnect</li>
	<li>Neils Bohr, conceived the atom as a miniature solar system with electrons orbiting around the central nucleus</li>
	<li>simple fire pump gave william harvey the notion of how the heart works</li>
	<li>Humming bird with its ability to hover and fly backwards inspired the invention of helicopter</li>
</ul>
When in a state on creative mental block, look to the nature for inspiration ...
<ul>
	<li>bu observing a shipworm tunneling through timber, Sir Marc Brunel solved the problem of underwater construction of tunnel</li>
	<li>da Vince was truly prolific ion observing nature. Studying natural life in minute detail, he then transformed his observations into a deluge of inventions, real and virtual</li>
	<li>human eye provided the inspiration for the modern automatic focus and exposure cameras</li>
	<li>military for the idea of camouflage from creatures in the wild who used this scheme as an act of concealment from predators</li>
	<li>fish's swim bladder inspired the design of the submarine's usage of the underwater ballast</li>
</ul>
and lastly... an astonishing account of time... in our lifetime on average we spend
<ul>
	<li>5 years standing in line</li>
	<li>one year looking for misplaced objects</li>
	<li>8 months opening direct mails</li>
	<li>2 years returning calls</li>
	<li>25 years sleeping</li>
	<li>6 years sleeping</li>
	<li>4 years doing chores</li>
</ul>
