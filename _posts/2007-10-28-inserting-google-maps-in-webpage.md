here's how to embed it in a really easy manner...

1. Create your own \*. [kml](http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/)/ \*. [kmz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) Google map file in your desktop Google Earth
2. LoginÂ to [Google Earth Community](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/ubbthreads.php/Cat/0)
3. Create a thread of your own to upload the created kml / kmz file eg. [mine!](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showflat.php?Cat=0&Board=myplaces&Number=721910&Searchpage=1&Main=721910&Words=+sweska&topic=&Search=true#Post721910)
4. Click -> View in Google Maps and it'll take you to another web page ( [mine](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/download.php?Number=722822&t=k&om=1))
5. Click -> Link to this page -> Paste HTML to embed in website
6. cut and paste the code :P
7. and the result.... have fun navigating right here! i totally love the interactivity

Now, why do i say it's the easy way?? Coz we just need to cut and paste the code

here's some other links to do it in other ways... and i really gotta learn to with the APIs and javascript to do it the 'harder' or more interesting way!

1. Embed [google my maps](http://ongopongo.com/maps/google_my_maps_embedding_tool)
2. [dr2000](http://www.dr2ooo.com/tools/maps/)
3. [digital geography](http://www.digitalgeography.co.uk/juicy-geography/)
4. [Google Maps API](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/)
5. [google mapplets](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapplets/)
