<p align="justify"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> is one of the Fathers of United States of America. A great leader and a Diplomat. It's definitely valuable to take a look at <a href="http://www.flamebright.com/PTPages/Benjamin.asp">his 13 virtues</a> and the way he himself practised it:</p>
<p align="justify">1. <strong>Temperance:</strong> Eat not to dullness and drink not to elevation.</p>
<p align="justify">2. <strong>Silence:</strong> Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling conversation.</p>
<p align="justify">3. <strong>Order:</strong> Let all your things have their places. Let each part of your business have its time.</p>
<p align="justify">4. <strong>Resolution:</strong> Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.</p>
<p align="justify">5. <strong>Frugality:</strong> Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself: i.e. Waste nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">6. <strong>Industry:</strong> Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary actions.</p>
<p align="justify">7. <strong>Sincerity:</strong> Use no hurtful deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify">8. <strong>Justice:</strong> Wrong none, by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty.</p>
<p align="justify">9. <strong>Moderation:</strong> Avoid extremes. Forebear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.</p>
<p align="justify">10. <strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Tolerate no uncleanness in body, clothes or habitation.</p>
<p align="justify">11. <strong>Chastity:</strong> Rarely use venery but for health or offspring; Never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.</p>
<p align="justify">12. <strong>Tranquility:</strong> Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.</p>
<p align="justify">13. <strong>Humility:</strong> Imitate Jesus and Socrates.</p>
