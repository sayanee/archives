[Benjamin Franklin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin) is one of the Fathers of United States of America. A great leader and a Diplomat. It's definitely valuable to take a look at [his 13 virtues](http://www.flamebright.com/PTPages/Benjamin.asp) and the way he himself practised it:

1. **Temperance:** Eat not to dullness and drink not to elevation.

2. **Silence:** Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling conversation.

3. **Order:** Let all your things have their places. Let each part of your business have its time.

4. **Resolution:** Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.

5. **Frugality:** Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself: i.e. Waste nothing.

6. **Industry:** Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary actions.

7. **Sincerity:** Use no hurtful deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.

8. **Justice:** Wrong none, by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty.

9. **Moderation:** Avoid extremes. Forebear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.

10. **Cleanliness:** Tolerate no uncleanness in body, clothes or habitation.

11. **Chastity:** Rarely use venery but for health or offspring; Never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.

12. **Tranquility:** Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.

13. **Humility:** Imitate Jesus and Socrates.
