<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

some assumptions
<ul>
	<li>you are always presenting information</li>
	<li>your style has weaknesses and strengths</li>
	<li>skills are learned and therefore can be taught</li>
	<li>skills have only been learned if they are demonstrated or observable</li>
	<li>presentations are only effective if the skills taught are outside the training room</li>
	<li>audience is more important than you. Leave any personal matters outside the training room</li>
	<li>creating an atmosphere is the responsibility of the presenter</li>
</ul>
 how we process information
<ol>
	<li>Sight - Visual System</li>
	<li>Hearing - Auditory System</li>
	<li>Touch - Kinesthetic System</li>
	<li>Smell - Olfactory System</li>
	<li>Taste - Gustatory System</li>
</ol>
on dressing...
<blockquote>people are more likely to be influenced by 2 piece suit and even more by 3 piece suit!</blockquote>
 attitudes that make an impact with an audience usually include...
<ul>
	<li>passion and enthusiasm for what you are teaching</li>
	<li>curiosity towards the audience</li>
	<li>energy focused in the room</li>
	<li>consideration for the effects you have on others</li>
	<li>open-minded for views different to your own</li>
	<li>tenacity in times of difficulty</li>
	<li>being thorough, yet not too serious</li>
</ul>
anchoring...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Excellent presenters orchestrate their movements in such a way that participants can pick up associates at an unconscious level. Each movement has its own meaning and you can use these gestures or movements to elicit a particular response form the groups.</p>
<p align="justify">Information is given back at the whiteboard while questions are answered when you move closer to the audience. Giving anecdotal experiences and stories to reinforce your work has also been designated a specific area. If you follow this plan consistently, moving to the front of the stage signals to the group that it's time to ask questions.</p>
