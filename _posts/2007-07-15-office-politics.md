I really don't know anything about this since i have not started work, but i thought that this  [article](http://www.bnet.com/2403-13070_23-93243.html) shows a really good grasp on how to deal with office politics...

1. Figure Out Why (and If) You Want to Play
2. Create Strong Relationships
3. Observe and Listen
4. Promote Yourself, Tactfully
5. Help Your Colleagues
