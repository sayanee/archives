<p align="justify">When i surf around... i come across awesome talent, creativity and most importantly bravery to plunge into something never ventured before. I am inspired and stunned by their imagination and determination. But even more stunning is their age... they are so young. Ok correction - as old as me and barely into their 20s. And i truly salute their courage of this generation... my generation.</p>
