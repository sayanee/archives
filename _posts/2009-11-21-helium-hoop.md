This must be one of the most impromptu, simplest and laughter-inducing game! All you need is 10 to 15 people, ask them to touch the hula-hoop with <em>only</em> their index fingers and they must put down the hoop to the ground!

And then watch the fun... the helium hoop will miraculously rise! And if you are one of the people attempting to put down the hula hoop and you are like me, you will be laughing so much that the helium hoop will continue to rise even faster!

No wonder it's called the <a href="http://www.facilitutor.com/gameDisplay.php?id=14">Helium Hoop</a> - it rises miraculously!
