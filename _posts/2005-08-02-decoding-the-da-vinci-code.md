ooooohh!! Finally finished reading controversial Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. Great book and I loved it!! The book was like a high-speed race...events unfolding one after another as the heroes Langdon and Sophie tried to break the codes to get the next clues. Something like a dramatic treasure hunt. I'm more into non-fiction, but i loved this booked because it deals with issues that I already like and read about...things like Golden Ratio, Phi, Fibonacci Sequence, anagrams and mysteries embedded in history. The occasional la langue francais made me realize that hmmm...I might not have forgotten so much French after all! C'est bien! N'est pas?

It also rekindled interest in certain issues like... Paintings and Leonardo da Vinci--> This book dealt with famous paintings like Vitruvian man, Madonna of the Rocks, The Last Supper and of course The Mona Lisa. Dan Brown explained the hidden meanings behind these paintings.

History--> _History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated and the winner writes the history books - book, which glorifies their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As Napolean once said," What is history, but a fabled agreed upon?" _ Religion and Reality--> pg 370_--Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality. And living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people _pg 370_--Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metamorphical. _ Faith and Fabrication--> pg 369--_Every faith in the world is based on fabrication. That is the definition of faith - acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove. Every religion describes God through metaphors, allegory, and exaggeration, from the early Egyptians through modern Sunday school. Metaphors are a way to help our minds process the unprocessible. The problem arises when we begin to believe literally in our own metaphors. _ So, now the main question...why is this book controversial?? Da Vinci code tries to uncover a supposed truth that is hidden from the world for 2000 years. And this supposed truth is about Jesus Christ himself! Lalala…I can’t tell you what. You’ll have to read the book! Personally, for me it is not so much about whether Dan Bown is saying the truth…in order to judge this I would have to read a lot lot more about Christian history and the Religion. He did raise pertinent thoughts that made me think. He also did a brilliant job by combining Da vinci with Issac Newton, Walt Disney and Mozart.

Hmmm....i wanna read more about hidden meanings behind Da Vinci's works and early Chrsitian History. Anyway, check out [Dan Brown's website ](http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/reviews.html)and also Prof. Aslaksen's website on [Mathematics in Art and Architecture. ](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/math-art-arch.html)

So, what do you think lies hidden behind these lines? _O, Draconican Devil Oh, Lame saint!_
