<p align="justify">Gazillion things happened for the past few weeks. I was travelling again but this time my parents were here and we must have done almost all the touristy things possible in <strong><font color="#800080">France, Holland and Belgium!</font></strong>  But it was really really good... you know places and things are touristy for a reason ;) We saw immensely beautiful things right from history to nature to culture. More importantly, we had our long awaited family holiday because the last one was 15 years back when I was not even a teenager!</p>
<p align="justify">In short: <a href="/2008/02/27/a-gift-for-him-her/">Mission Accomplished</a>. Yes, even though this is my first time in Europe or travelling entirely on my own, I did manage to figure things out and even bring my parents here. Hurraaayyy!!!! And now it looks like it's almost time to go home as well, isn't it?</p>
