<p align="justify">Wondering how to describe this emptiness that's engulfing...Â Still searching for the exact answers and i better find them fast, because there's not much time left. I am not good with words unlike <em>someone</em>, and so as usual a picture will say <a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/James-Blunt/Tears-And-Rain.html">the words</a> for me...</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.
