Wondering how to describe this emptiness that's engulfing...Â Still searching for the exact answers and i better find them fast, because there's not much time left. I am not good with words unlike _someone_, and so as usual a picture will say [the words](http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/James-Blunt/Tears-And-Rain.html) for me...

> I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain, All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble. Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray. I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble. It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.
