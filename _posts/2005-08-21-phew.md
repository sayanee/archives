DANG!!!!....I failed my **sight-reading**…AGAIN!!!....

My examiner’s comment: _You kept going determinedly, but note reading was rather unsure generally, and the basic rhythm should have been in 4 time, not 3._

How wonderful…I STILL do not know the difference between 4 and 3 time…but what a relief that overall I **PASSED!!!!!!!** Onto the next stage…and the practice begins now.
