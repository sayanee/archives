<img border="0" align="left" src="/img/prac6.jpg" hspace="10" />DANG!!!!....I failed my <strong><font color="#cc0000">sight-reading</font></strong>…AGAIN!!!....

My examiner’s comment: <em>You kept going determinedly, but note reading was rather unsure generally, and the basic rhythm should have been in 4 time, not 3.
</em>How wonderful…I STILL do not know the difference between 4 and 3 time…but what a relief that overall I <font color="#666633"><strong>PASSED!!!!!!!</strong> </font>

Onto the next stage…and the practice begins now.
