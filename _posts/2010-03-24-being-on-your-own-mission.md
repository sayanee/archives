A beautiful article on [This is my Theme Part, What should I scream for](http://www.pluginid.com/theme-park-scream-for/)?  Very aptly put:

> Two important things I’ve noticed since being on my own mission over the last 24 months are: - The less you talk about your success (in most cases), the more people there are who want to follow your journey - The less you focus on external “rewards” (money, relationships, status) the more likely they are to appear
