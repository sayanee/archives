<strong>Book Title: </strong>The Red Rubber Ball at work
<strong> Author</strong>: Kevin Carroll
<strong> Year written/published: </strong>2009
<strong> Book Source:</strong> Google Books, Library
<strong> Summary:</strong> Personal accounts of business leaders and creative artists about their childhood play versus their adult playtimes during work. And these accounts are categorized according to Innovation, Results, Teamwork, Leadership, Curiosity.
<strong> My Comments:</strong> A very fun book... reading both the childhood and adult parallels makes it think that one should indeed not grow up!
<strong> Some extracts:</strong>

“We didn’t know what we didn’t know. That’s quite empowering because when you don’t know the reasons it can’t be done, then it kind of can.”
Tom Kelley, General Manager, IDEO
