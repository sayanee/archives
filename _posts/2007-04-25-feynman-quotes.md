<p align="justify">I have always loved books by Richard Feynman. He's a brilliant physicist, a teacher and most importantly he has a great insigh to life itself!</p>
<p align="justify">Here are some of my favourite quotes from Feynman... and of course <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">more out there</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">We can't <strong>define</strong> anything precisely</p>
<p align="justify">Dear Mrs. Chown, Ignore your son's attempts to teach you physics. Physics isn't the most important thing. Love is. Best wishes, Richard Feynman.</p>
<p align="justify">There are all kinds of interesting questions that come from a knowledge of science, which only adds to the excitement and mystery and awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.</p>
<p align="justify">Physics is like sex. Sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it. Physics is to math what sex is to masturbation.</p>
<p align="justify">Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.</p>
<p align="justify">You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing — that's what counts. I learned very early <strong>the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I can live with <strong>doubt and uncertainty</strong> and not knowing. I think it is much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers that might be wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">There are 10<sup>11</sup> stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A poet once said "The whole universe is in a glass of wine." We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflections in the glass, and our imaginations adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the Earth's rocks, and in its composition we see the secret of the universe's age, and the evolution of the stars. What strange array of chemicals are there in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts — physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on — remember that Nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>God</strong> was invented to explain mystery. God is always invented to explain those things that you do not understand. Now, when you finally discover how something works, you get some laws which you're taking away from God; you don't need him anymore. But you need him for the other mysteries. So therefore you leave him to create the universe because we haven't figured that out yet; you need him for understanding those things which you don't believe the laws will explain, such as consciousness, or why you only live to a certain length of time — life and death — stuff like that. God is always associated with those things that you do not understand. Therefore I don't think that the laws can be considered to be like God because they have been figured out.</p>
