> It’s been said that you should always work at 2 jobs simultaneously: the one you have and the one you desire. When you work as hard at the task you want to do as the task you must do, you are preparing yourself for the future. You are learning skills that will enable you to grow beyond your present position … When the time comes, you’ll be ready.

thoughts in mind... >  

> You will never be greater than the thoughts that dominate your mind. Keep up with what’s new in your field and with what’s going on in the world. Make a list of good ideas that you can use anytime you are searching for a creative solution to a problem. Remember, small minds think about things, great minds think about ideas.

decisiveness >  

> Success people are decisive; they don’t agonise over decisions and thereby miss out on a great opportunity. They gather relevant information, discuss alternatives with advisors whose opinions they respect and then make a decision and get on with it.
