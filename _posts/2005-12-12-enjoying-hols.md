Whooopie!!! Today I had my first day at the California Fitness and Tuition.Yes I joined [California fitness](http://www.calfitnesscenters.com/home.jsp?country=sg&lang=en)...coz this is what I’m paying – **58 bucks** monthly for UMLIMITED usage of gym and all the fitness classes (aerobics, yoga, pilates, dance etc) and a one time joining fee of **40**. I took the student package and my fitness consultant says I can actually continue to use this same price even when I’m working in future....hmmmm how’s that possible!??!? Anyway it’s quite a deal right?!?!? Otherwise nothing new from Amore. Been there done that.

Another good thing is that it’s open from like 6am to 12 midnight...so I can go for classes at 7am and then go school... but dad claims I’ll never wake up to do this... \*\*squint squint\*\* Anyway the main point is.... JOIN ME!!!!!! There’s also a trial promotion going on – **18 bucks** for unlimited use this month. So go down to the orchard branch within the next 3 days...HURRY!!!! Gosh I feel like I’m sales personnel...oh well!! But this definitely does not mean i'll quit swimming or jogging in my quiet AMK park ...yeah!!

I joined California fitness yesterday while I made poor caine and ogh wait for me...but thank you!! We took lots of boliao pics as usual...

Oh and another point...who wants to watch the FREE piano and violin competition with me?!?! Check out the schedule [**here**](http://www.nac.gov.sg/Data/competition/36/Comp%20Details-Anx%20A%20Schedule.doc) and the details ** [here](http://www.nac.gov.sg/com/com02a.asp?id=36)**!

Verdict again: student life is the best!!!
