<p align="justify"><span style="color: #330099;">Whooopie!!! </span>Today I had my first day at the California Fitness and Tuition.Yes I joined <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.calfitnesscenters.com/home.jsp?country=sg&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">California fitness</a>...coz this is what I’m paying – <span style="color: #666600;"><strong>58 bucks</strong> </span>monthly for UMLIMITED usage of gym and all the fitness classes (aerobics, yoga, pilates, dance etc) and a one time joining fee of <strong><span style="color: #996600;">40</span></strong>. I took the student package and my fitness consultant says I can actually continue to use this same price even when I’m working in future....hmmmm how’s that possible!??!? Anyway it’s quite a deal right?!?!? Otherwise nothing new from Amore. Been there done that.</p>
<p align="justify">Another good thing is that it’s open from like 6am to 12 midnight...so I can go for classes at 7am and then go school... but dad claims I’ll never wake up to do this... **squint squint** Anyway the main point is.... JOIN ME!!!!!! There’s also a trial promotion going on – <strong>18 bucks</strong> for unlimited use this month. So go down to the orchard branch within the next 3 days...HURRY!!!! Gosh I feel like I’m sales personnel...oh well!! But this definitely does not mean i'll quit swimming or jogging in my quiet AMK park ...yeah!!</p>
I joined California fitness yesterday while I made poor caine and ogh wait for me...but thank you!! We took lots of boliao pics as usual...

Check out the schedule <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.nac.gov.sg/Data/competition/36/Comp%20Details-Anx%20A%20Schedule.doc"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> </strong>and the details <strong><a class="vt-p" href="http://www.nac.gov.sg/com/com02a.asp?id=36">here</a></strong>!</p>
<p align="justify">Verdict again: student life is the best!!!</p>
