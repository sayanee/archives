From Michael Brin to his son <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin">Sergey Brin</a>, the co-founder of Google on Sergey's birthday...
<blockquote>You are growing stronger
On body, spirit and mind.
I am getting older
leaving decades behind

You are tough, you mine data,
You surf first and think later,
And you crawler fast as light
Wanders madly in the night

You work hard to squeeze a thesis
From the world wide web of feces
You live on the sunny coast
To you, my son I propose a toast

In the stately oval office
Clinton grimly counts his losses,
Plumpy interns taking turn,
Many wonderful returns!</blockquote>
