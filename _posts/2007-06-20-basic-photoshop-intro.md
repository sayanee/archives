And here's the last of the intro web pages... it's for <a href="/files/photoshop/">Photoshop</a> this time.
<p align="justify">My friend commented thatÂ it looks a lot like Web <strike>2.0</strike> 1.0 :P Yes, agreed... these pages were made in early 2004 when i used to teach multi-media during those undergrad hols. It's really no good just storing them in the hard disk, isn't it? So, after some minor patching up, i decided to share it all....</p>
Hope it helps for all who wants to pick up these stuff! Enjoy!!
