<strong>My Comments: </strong>I would recommend anybody who wants an introduction to strategy to read this book. I especially loved the thorough explanation of different frameworks of strategy.
<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

Kocourek, Burger, Birchard propose 12 questions boards should ask in the course of discharging their oversigh responsibilities:
<ol>
	<li>Does the management have a comprehensive strategy and operating plan for the company to realize its performance potential? (Strategic direction)</li>
	<li>Are the necessary human, financial, physical and other supporting resources provided and properly allocated to achieve success? (Resource allocation)</li>
	<li>Does the CEO provide the leadership required by the company and does the organisation have a succession plan for this position? (Management)</li>
	<li>Does the management use an effective system of key performance indicators to monitor and control operation performance? (Operating Controls)</li>
	<li>... ...</li>
</ol>
Methods to speed up ( as a competitive advantage)
<ol>
	<li>Streamlining operation</li>
	<li>upgrading technology</li>
	<li>forming partnerships</li>
</ol>
Fundamentally, 6 mandates drive innovation at 3M:
<ol>
	<li>Support innovation from R&amp;D to customer sales and support</li>
	<li>Understand the future by trying to anticipate and analyse future trends</li>
	<li>Establish stretch goals</li>
	<li>Empower employees to meet goals</li>
	<li>Support broad networking across the company</li>
	<li>recognize and reward innovative people</li>
</ol>
