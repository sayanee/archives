I had a fun time yesterday running around and reaching Creative Crew meeting just in time to present a short session on the "Colors of the Sky". I presented on something that was very close to my heart - Design and the Universe. If you have ever wondered how the galaxy pictures are made, how scientists combine pictures from telescope to make these [breathtaking images](http://hubblesite.org/gallery/album/entire/pr2005002f/) then you must certainly check out the free Photoshop Plugin - [FITS Liberator](http://www.spacetelescope.org/projects/fits_liberator/).

It is indeed very encouraging to see the science and astronomical bodies sharing these images and tools so freely for the public. Maybe one day, the deep space telescopes will be churning out so many photos that the community, us will be actively involved in creating these beautiful images. Have fun experimenting! :D
