<p align="justify">What Google is to Internet Search, Photoshop has become the verb for saying digital graphic manipulation. And ooooohhh!!! I just gotta photoshop more and more. Some of my friends were asking me how do i edit and make the pic collages. While i have loads to learn, i'll just share with you what i usually do with photos and photoshop and how i am still learning.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#003333">The Software
</font></strong>I use Photoshop CS2 and you can also try a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/downloads/alphabetical.html#sort-j">30 day free trial version </a>on the net. Like a million others out there would say, photoshop is a simply brilliant software. I always like to trace back in history to how it all started in 1989. I think it's really nostalgic to see the <a target="_blank" href="http://creativebits.org/the_first_version_of_photoshop">Version 1 of Photoshop</a> and as you travel through time take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guidebookgallery.org/splashes/photoshop">splashes of photoshop</a>. Interesting eh!!

</p><p align="justify"><strong><font color="#003333">Filters</font></strong>
This is an amazing stuff. You can turn a photo into an art piece like water painting. While doing some image processing for my internship last year i learnt the algorithms behind some of these filters. They actually <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~brayer/vision/fourier.html" title="Read more">manipulate pixels</a> by Fourier and Laplace series... Sheeesh!!! So photoshop filters aren't much different from digital signal filters.

</p><p align="justify"><strong><font color="#003333">Add-ons
</font></strong>One of my favorite plugins is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flamingpear.com/download.html">Flaming Pears</a>. I use a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flamingpear.com/download.html#melancholytron">Melancholytron</a>. It adds a gloomy artsy touch to any photo. And another wonderful plugin is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flamingpear.com/download.html#flood">Flood</a>... it'll create waves to just anything... as if there is a <a target="_blank" href="http://flickr.com/photos/roquentin/sets/1082585/" title="Ivan's Sinking City Set">sinking city</a>!!

</p><p align="justify"><strong><font color="#003333">Digital Scrapbooking</font></strong>
There are loads of free goodies once again. Whether is it nice background papers, or clips, or ribbons - you can find them all under Digital Scrapbooking. What makes digital scrapbooking different is that these files are *.png which supports transparencies unlike *.jpeg file. Thus when you want to add a pic border, you just need to put the frame on the layer above the actual photo and not worry about erasing layers. I especially like sites like <a target="_blank" href="http://digitalscrapbookplace.com/place/freebies.shtml">Digital Scrapbook Place</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scrapbook-bytes.com/chat/local_links.php?catid=5">Digital Bytes</a>. Go ahead and create a free account and download the page kits. But of course, no <a target="_blank" href="http://jenjen.typepad.com/stoppiracy/2005/11/what_is_piracy.html">digital piracy</a>... so we should not use them for commercial purpose and pass them around even to friends.

</p><p align="justify"><strong><font color="#003333">More and more tricks
</font></strong>There are loads of sites with photoshop tutorials like <a target="_blank" href="http://pstutorialsblog.com/">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.photoshoptutorial.net/web_graphics_tutorials/page1/">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.photoshop.brushes.btinternet.co.uk/">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tutorialized.com/tutorials/Photoshop/1">there</a>.
</p><p align="justify">And that's just the end of the tiny bit of stuff i know and would like to share... ok i better get back to bed and rest... otherwise mom's gonna confiscate my laptop. I'm really sian being so sick... so suay to have fever again <font size="2">:neutral:</font></p>
