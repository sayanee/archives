What Google is to Internet Search, Photoshop has become the verb for saying digital graphic manipulation. And ooooohhh!!! I just gotta photoshop more and more. Some of my friends were asking me how do i edit and make the pic collages. While i have loads to learn, i'll just share with you what i usually do with photos and photoshop and how i am still learning.

**The Software **I use Photoshop CS2 and you can also try a [30 day free trial version ](http://www.adobe.com/downloads/alphabetical.html#sort-j)on the net. Like a million others out there would say, photoshop is a simply brilliant software. I always like to trace back in history to how it all started in 1989. I think it's really nostalgic to see the [Version 1 of Photoshop](http://creativebits.org/the_first_version_of_photoshop) and as you travel through time take a look at the [splashes of photoshop](http://www.guidebookgallery.org/splashes/photoshop). Interesting eh!!

**Filters** This is an amazing stuff. You can turn a photo into an art piece like water painting. While doing some image processing for my internship last year i learnt the algorithms behind some of these filters. They actually [manipulate pixels](http://www.cs.unm.edu/~brayer/vision/fourier.html "Read more") by Fourier and Laplace series... Sheeesh!!! So photoshop filters aren't much different from digital signal filters.

**Add-ons **One of my favorite plugins is [Flaming Pears](http://www.flamingpear.com/download.html). I use a lot of [Melancholytron](http://www.flamingpear.com/download.html#melancholytron). It adds a gloomy artsy touch to any photo. And another wonderful plugin is [Flood](http://www.flamingpear.com/download.html#flood)... it'll create waves to just anything... as if there is a [sinking city](http://flickr.com/photos/roquentin/sets/1082585/ "Ivan's Sinking City Set")!!

**Digital Scrapbooking** There are loads of free goodies once again. Whether is it nice background papers, or clips, or ribbons - you can find them all under Digital Scrapbooking. What makes digital scrapbooking different is that these files are \*.png which supports transparencies unlike \*.jpeg file. Thus when you want to add a pic border, you just need to put the frame on the layer above the actual photo and not worry about erasing layers. I especially like sites like [Digital Scrapbook Place](http://digitalscrapbookplace.com/place/freebies.shtml) and [Digital Bytes](http://www.scrapbook-bytes.com/chat/local_links.php?catid=5). Go ahead and create a free account and download the page kits. But of course, no [digital piracy](http://jenjen.typepad.com/stoppiracy/2005/11/what_is_piracy.html)... so we should not use them for commercial purpose and pass them around even to friends.

**More and more tricks **There are loads of sites with photoshop tutorials like [here](http://pstutorialsblog.com/), [here](http://www.photoshoptutorial.net/web_graphics_tutorials/page1/), [here](http://www.photoshop.brushes.btinternet.co.uk/) and [there](http://www.tutorialized.com/tutorials/Photoshop/1).

And that's just the end of the tiny bit of stuff i know and would like to share... ok i better get back to bed and rest... otherwise mom's gonna confiscate my laptop. I'm really sian being so sick... so suay to have fever again :neutral:
