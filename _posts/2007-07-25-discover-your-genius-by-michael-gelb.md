<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

Some thought provoking quotations...
<blockquote>life must be lived as play
~ Plato

We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time
~T. S. Elit's The 4 Quartets

History knows of no man who ever did the like
~ Inscription on Columbus' tomb in Seville Cathedral

Success does not always go along with merit: America is not named after Columbus
~Sigmund Freud

the speculations of a philosopher are far removed form the judgement of the multitude, for his aim is to seek truth in all things
~Copernicus, preface to the Revolution of the heavenly spheres

Video et taceo (I see but i say nothing)
~Elizabeth I1s motto

All the world's a stage
And all the men and women are merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts...
~Shakespeare, As You Like It

For a bowl of water give a goodly mean;
For a kindly greeting bow thou down with zeal;
For a simple penny pay thou back with gold;
If thy life me rescued, life do not withhold;
Thus the words and actions of the wise regard;
Every little service tenfold they reward;
But the truly noble know all men as one,
And <strong>return with gladness good for every evil done</strong>.
~ Hindi sacred text

Study and in general the pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to remain children all our lives
~ Albert Einstein</blockquote>
