Normal distribution/Gaussian distribution has many applications.

All normal density curves satisfy the following property:
<ul>
	<li>68% of the observations fall within 1? of the mean, that is, between ? – ? and ? + ?.</li>
	<li>95% of the observations fall within 2? of the mean, that is, between ? – 2? and ? + 2?.</li>
	<li>99.7% of the observations fall within 3? of the mean, that is, between ? – 3? and ? + 3?.</li>
	<li>Almost all values lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
</ul>
