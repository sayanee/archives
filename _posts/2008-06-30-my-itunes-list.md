I have been in love with podcasts and iTunes. When reading books are not the luxury (crowded commuting or just a mood for something different other than reading), listening to podcasts while on the go is always a step ahead... my list includes...

1. Amateur Travels
2. QDT
3. Beautiful Places in HD
4. The Welch Way
5. Photoshop killer tips
6. Pixel Perfect
7. Tekzilla
8. Pop Siren
9. TWIP
10. SKywatch
11. 65 bits
12. Travel with Rick Steeves
13. Planet Green Podcast
14. Lightroom for digital photographers
