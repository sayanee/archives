A <a href="http://networkedblogs.com/7yQ9u">very thoughtful list from Alison</a>:
<ol>
	<li><strong>You are only as good as the people you surround yourself with.</strong></li>
	<li>Eating psata with a group of Italians is the best thing for your heart.</li>
	<li>Dance even when there is no music and even if you are the only one on the dance floor.</li>
	<li>Headphones are the best medicine for ADD.</li>
	<li><strong>Believe your going to live forever, but live like you are going to die next week.</strong></li>
	<li>Share your fears with friends, they will help you overcome them.</li>
	<li>Hug your friends and co-workers daily.</li>
	<li>Always have friends that are muscians.</li>
	<li>Speak more tha  one language.</li>
	<li>Let all your energy shine out form your heart when you speak, your passion is what drives others</li>
	<li>Say please and thank you even when you are being a bitch</li>
	<li>Go to bed when you feel like it</li>
	<li>When you have to choose between 2 things, choose both</li>
	<li><strong>Think big, and take small steps</strong></li>
	<li>Too much energy is a good thing when you are changing the world</li>
	<li>Have kids, adopt a kid, or work to help kids. Loving someone more than yourslef is a true gift.</li>
	<li>Wear your heart on your sleeve. It may be easily broken, but it's also easily seen and this easily repaired.</li>
	<li><strong>The risk is always worth it.</strong></li>
	<li>If you want something bad enough, be willing to do the work.</li>
	<li>Be trist-worthy. Trust is a rare and valuable commodity.</li>
	<li>It doesn't matter how much you spend on others, as long as it fits properly.</li>
</ol>
