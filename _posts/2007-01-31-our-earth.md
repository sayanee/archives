title: Our Earth far away - a pale blue dot!
---

How do you think our earth looks like really really far away? This photo was taken by [Voyager 1](http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/) when it was in the out skirts of the Solar System.

And i think [Carl Sagan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) has described this **blue dot** really beautifully...

> That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there -- on **a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam**.

and a really inspiring video with these words of Carl Sagan...
