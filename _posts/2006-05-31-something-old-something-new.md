<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#003333">Something Old: Stitching</font>
</strong>Let me see..when was the last time i did this?? Sec 2?? Yeah and that was like 9 years back!! Uh well...i guess i liked home econs too. So today after making some initial disasters with the pillow cover flower design, guess i did pretty well. Mom wasn't that critical for once ahah!!

<p align="justify"><font color="#003366"><strong>Something New: Scraping
</strong></font><font color="#000000">Now i finally understand why huiling likes scarpbooking. Well, i discovered something different though... it is digital scrapbooking. It doesn't involve ribbons, scissors or buttons... but more of photoshop, *.png files and layers... love it!! And with the internet there are loads of freebies for digital scrapbooking. I'm being on an experimental mood now...</font>
