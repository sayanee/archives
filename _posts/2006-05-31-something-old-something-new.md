I had a really good rest doing something old and something new right in the comfort of my roomie.

**Something Old: Stitching** Let me see..when was the last time i did this?? Sec 2?? Yeah and that was like 9 years back!! Uh well...i guess i liked home econs too. So today after making some initial disasters with the pillow cover flower design, guess i did pretty well. Mom wasn't that critical for once ahah!!

**Something New: Scraping** Now i finally understand why huiling likes scarpbooking. Well, i discovered something different though... it is digital scrapbooking. It doesn't involve ribbons, scissors or buttons... but more of photoshop, \*.png files and layers... love it!! And with the internet there are loads of freebies for digital scrapbooking. I'm being on an experimental mood now... So check out both...
