<p align="justify"><strong><img align="left" src="/img/choc_fridge.jpg" /></strong>I got this pic for mom to show her all the chocolates i got from Berlin and Brussels... they are all piled up in my little fridge!</p>
<p align="justify">And she asked me to taste one of them and if I like them, I should buy more... bad advice. So i opened that Belgium dark chocolate bar and half was finished within an hour. <em>That's alright!</em> I'm merely tasting them and by the time i write this, well it's actually all gone.</p>
<p align="justify">Please hope that i don't gobble down all of my entire chocolate store before they all reach you guys!! Any suggestion to somehow lock them up and keep them away from me?</p>
<p align="justify">*yummm.. <em>that</em> one looks good too... i should have a bite*</p>
