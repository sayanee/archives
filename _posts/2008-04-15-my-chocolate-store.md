I got this pic for mom to show her all the chocolates i got from Berlin and Brussels... they are all piled up in my little fridge!

And she asked me to taste one of them and if I like them, I should buy more... bad advice. So i opened that Belgium dark chocolate bar andÂ half was finished within an hour. _That's alright!_ I'm merely tasting them and by the time i write this, well it's actually all gone.

Please hope that i don't gobble down all of my entire chocolate store before they all reach you guys!! Any suggestion to somehow lock them up and keep them away from me?

\*yummm.. _that_ one looks good too... i should have a bite\*
