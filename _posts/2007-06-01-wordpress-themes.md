To look around for a nice theme, we can scout around [here](http://themes.wordpress.net/).

To install the new theme, we put the folder of the theme downloaded in folder wp-content/themes of our blog. And then when we come to the Admin panel -> Presentation -> Themes, the themes is autpmatically there for us to select.

A typical theme folder has the following contents:
- index.php
- style.css
- 'images' folder with all the images
- other \*.php files known as [template files](http://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Templates)Â which runs according to the [hierarchy](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy) as shown very neatly in [this image](http://www.scoutpress.de/download/wp_Template_Hierarchy.png)

ok just a brief intro to WP themes. I've only learnt this much so far :P
