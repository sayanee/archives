To look around for a nice theme, we can scout around <a href="http://themes.wordpress.net/">here</a>.
<p align="justify">To install the new theme, we put the folder of the theme downloaded in folder <font color="#800000">wp-content/themes</font> of our blog. And then when we come to the <font color="#800000">Admin panel -&gt; Presentation -&gt; Themes</font>, the themes is autpmatically there for us to select.</p>
A typical theme folder has the following contents:
<ul>
	<li>index.php</li>
	<li>style.css</li>
	<li>'images' folder with all the images</li>
	<li>other *.php files known as <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Templates">template files</a>Â which runs according to the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy">hierarchy</a> as shown very neatly in <a href="http://www.scoutpress.de/download/wp_Template_Hierarchy.png">this image</a></li>
</ul>
ok just a brief intro to WP themes. I've only learnt this much so far :P
