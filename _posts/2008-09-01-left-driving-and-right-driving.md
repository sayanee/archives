title: Left driving and Right driving
---

Ever wondered why some countries have [left hand driving and others have right hand driving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_on_the_left_or_right)?? Here's an interesting [peak at the history and origin](http://users.telenet.be/worldstandards/driving%20on%20the%20left.htm#history)...

> In the past, almost everybody travelled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal, violent societies. Since most people are right-handed, swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him. Moreover, it reduced the chance of the scabbard (worn on the left) hitting other people.

I have been familiar with left driving countries mostly, but it is interesting to note that [75%Â  cuntries in the world are right driving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Countries_driving_on_the_left_or_right.svg)!
