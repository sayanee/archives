<p align="justify"><strong><img align="left" src="/img/beer_glass_amsterdam.jpg" />Chef:</strong> You are sure you don't wanna try some Dutch beer?
<strong>Me:</strong> Oh i would love too! But ... eerr i don't really drink, i mean i'm not used to... so ordering one whole glass would be a waste!
<strong>Chef:</strong> You are in this city and you must try this! Let me give you a full glass *wink*
<p align="justify">And so i had my first glass of beer... Dutch beer that is in the middle of Centrum Amsterdam along with nachos and spanish tapas :P</p>
<p align="justify">Uuuuuhhh i just love these sunday lunches... each sunday lunch being spent in a different city with a new taste. Yes i do love that 2 little gulps of Dutch Beer in a miniature beer glass.</p>
<p align="justify">So where will be my next Sunday's lunch?</p>
