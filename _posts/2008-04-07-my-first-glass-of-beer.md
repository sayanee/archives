**Chef:** You are sure you don't wanna try some Dutch beer?

**Me:** Oh i would love too! But ... eerr i don't really drink, i mean i'm not used to... so ordering one whole glass would be a waste!

**Chef:** You are in this city and you must try this! Let me give you a full glass \*wink\*

And so i had my first glass of beer... Dutch beer that is in the middle of Centrum Amsterdam along with nachos and spanish tapas :P

Uuuuuhhh i just love these sunday lunches... each sunday lunch being spent in a different city with a new taste. Yes i do love that 2 little gulps of Dutch Beer in a miniature beer glass.

So where will be my next Sunday's lunch?
