---

phew... finally figured out how to do file transfer. I think it's really important when u have your own domain and u need to transfer files and folders from your pc to the server and vice versa. Here's how i have learnt to do it :P

1. Download an FTP Client, eg. [Smart FTP ](http://www.download.com/SmartFTP/3000-2160-10028635.html)(32 bit)
2. Open the Smart FTP
3. Address: **ftp.XXXX.com**
4. Login: **userId**
5. password:
6. Port: 21
7. Enter!
8. Now we can do file transfer

Â Yeahhhhhh!!!!!!
