<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

definition of a career portfolio…
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A career portfolio is not a resume, which simply lists your experiences and accomplishments. Nor is it a cover letter in which you write about yourself and your qualifications for a particular job. Instead, it is a collection of actual documents that support and make tangible the things you want to say about yourself in a cover letter, a resume or a face-to-face interview. Letters of recommendations, performance evaluation, certificates, papers, pictures of things created or of activities led are all examples of items that might be included in a career portfolio.</p>
