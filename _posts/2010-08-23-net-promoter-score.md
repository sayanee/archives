[Net Promoter Score](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) asks this simple questions "How likely is it that you would recommend our company to a friend or colleague?" on a scale of 1-10. Based on their responses, customers are categorized into one of three groups: Promoters (9-10 rating), Passives (7-8 rating), and Detractors (0-6 rating). The percentage of Detractors is then subtracted from the percentage of Promoters to obtain a Net Promoter score.
