I'm without my camera for a week already... well i kinda spoilt it with sodium chloride corrosion. Blame me and no one else. Guess my 2 hobbies cannot mix - Kayaking and photography. Obviously they can't. Stupid Sweska. I'm not feeling so sad and devastated as i thought i would. Well, i guess for the next many many more months you guys won't have pics to see along with entries and of course my flickr won't have updates with new shots. And i don't even know when i can get a camera. Any sponspors?? Hee... kidding :P

What amazes me is that how easily i can just get on with life without the camera that has been with me for 3 years and taught me a lot. How easily i can let go of things that i knew so much, that is so dear to me. Yet, how easily i still cannot let go of things i never knew. They should have been left undiscovered, untold, unseen. Why am i even holding on to things i never knew? Strange Me...

Let go sweska.... Let go like the winds that blew across your face when you were in the midst of the sea, under the open sky....
