title: decisions in a blink
---

> It has long been a tenet of business theory that the best decisions are made after careful review and consideration. Only then can a practical decision be made. Now that model is being questioned by some business thinkers in the light of the theories of Malcolm Gladwell, who states that human beings make better decisions in the blink of an eye. Gladwell argues that on the contrary, the human mind is able to make complicated decisions quickly, and that **intuition often trumps an extended decision-making process**.
