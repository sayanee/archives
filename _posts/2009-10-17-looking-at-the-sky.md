I had always been intrigued by the astronomy and the study of universe. But it was only a few months back that i went for a few [telescope viewing sessions](http://www.sci-ctr.edu.sg/ssc/otmovie.jsp?type=8&root=82&parent=82&cat=110) and one weekend i managed to sneak out my way to [Pulau Semakau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulau_Semakau) for a star gazing night! For the first time in my life i caught the constellations and planets through the telescope... and i caught our very own moon.

But having spent an entire night under the sky, amidst the darkness, the quietness, i was convinced that i found the answer to all the world's _problems_. Whoaaa... so simple!! I couldn't really express how or why... but flipping through the [ pages written by Ekhart Tolle](http://eckharttolle.com/a_new_earth), I have found that exact thought... >  

> When you look up at the clear sky at night, you may easily realize a truth at once utterly simple and extraordinarily profound. What is that you see? The moon, planets, starts, the luminous band of the Milky Way, perhaps a comet or even the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy two million light years away. Yes, but if you simplify even more, what do you see? Objects floating in space. So what does the universe consist of? Objects and space. If you don't become speechless when looking out into space on a clear night, you are not really looking, not aware of the totality of what is there. You are probably only looking at at the objects and perhaps seeking to name them. ... ... The answer is both simple and profound. When you are aware of space, you are not really aware of anything, except awareness itself â€“ the inner space of consciousness. Through you, the universe is becoming aware of itself!

So, here it goes! I sheepishly childishly present that one simple solution to all the world's problems:

**Look at the Sky!** :D
