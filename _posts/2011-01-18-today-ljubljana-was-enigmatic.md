<p style="text-align: justify;">Today Ljubljana was completely covered with clouds that came down into the valley. It was so foggy that I could hardly see beyond 40metres and in a way it was unclear, and yetÂ beautiful. However, come afternoon the sun came out and everything was suddenly crystal clear, until there was a beautiful clear sky sunset!</p>
It's amazing how the exact same path looked so different in the dawn and the dusk. And it's the same with life - no matter where I am right now, there's always something to see beyond what I actually see.

Because the present moment is always enigmatic. Stay with it!
