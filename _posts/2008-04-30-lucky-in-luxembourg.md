<p align="justify">I have some story to tell about my weekend in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg_(city)">Luxembourg City</a>. This city is filled with deep valleys and forts and I spent the morning roaming along the <a href="http://www.aluxembourgattraction.com/luxembourg-attractions/the-wenzel-walk.htm">Wenzel Walk </a>high up at the edges of the cliff. And by the time it was afternoon, i went further down into the valley and took my 2 hours of idle thoughts beside the stream. So can you spot where i took the afternoon pic from the morning shot? uuuuuhh... plain bliss strolling up and down the valleys and forts of Luxembourg!</p>

<p align="justify">And now, this gets even more exciting... While strolling along Place d'Armes, I saw postcards featuring the Royalty of this country. And little while later, the main church was having celebrations and marching bands. Not forgetting to be both <em>Kaypo</em> and <em>Kiasu</em>, I went straight to the front door of the Church! And guess who i saw!!! I <strike>shook the hands of</strike> saw the Grand <a href="http://www.gouvernement.lu/dossiers/famille_grand_ducale/chregneuk/infobase/cvhenri.html">Duke</a>, the Grand <a href="http://www.gouvernement.lu/dossiers/famille_grand_ducale/chregneuk/infobase/cvmtheresa.html">Duchess </a>and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Alexandra_of_Luxembourg">Princess</a>!!!!! They were like right beside me... hmmm maybe after all I should have marched up a little more and shook their hands :s Uh well... my first brush with the rich and the famous! *ahem ahem*</p>
