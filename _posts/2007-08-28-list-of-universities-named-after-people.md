I found this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_named_after_people">list in Wiki rather interesting </a>- List of universities named after famous people. Surely the names were put due to their significnat contribution and to emulate their personalities and characters... it's a list worth looking at i feel :) Some includes that i know of....
<ol>
	<li>Cornell University - Ezra Cornell</li>
	<li>Carnegie Mellon University - Andrew Carnegie</li>
</ol>
