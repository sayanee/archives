I found this [list in Wiki rather interesting ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_named_after_people)- List of universities named after famous people. Surely the names were put due to their significnat contribution and to emulate their personalities and characters... it's a list worth looking at i feel :) Some includes that i know of....

1. Cornell University - Ezra Cornell
2. Carnegie Mellon University - Andrew Carnegie
