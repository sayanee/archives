Been hearing the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkins_Nutritional_Approach">Atkins Diet</a>. It is a form of low-carbohydrate and hihg-protein diet created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Atkins_%28nutritionist%29">Robert Atkins </a>in the 1960s. He used it first to combat his own over-weight problems and later it became popularised.
