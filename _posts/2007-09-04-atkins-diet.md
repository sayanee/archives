Been hearing the name [Atkins Diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkins_Nutritional_Approach). It is a form of low-carbohydrate and hihg-protein diet created by [Robert Atkins ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Atkins_%28nutritionist%29)in the 1960s. He used it first to combat his own over-weight problems and later it became popularised. Some links to know more about Atkins Diet...
