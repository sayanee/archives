Finally i found little applications that i can display on the desktop without the use of any browser or opening any applications... [Yahoo Widgets](http://widgets.yahoo.com/)!! Clocks, Convertors, weather, countdowns etc... Looks like i need to explore something similar - [Google Desktop gadget](http://desktop.google.com/)!
