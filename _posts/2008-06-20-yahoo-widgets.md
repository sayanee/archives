Finally i found little applications that i can display on the desktop without the use of any browser or opening any applications... <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Widgets</a>!! Clocks, Convertors, weather, countdowns etc...

Looks like i need to explore something similar - <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop gadget</a>!
