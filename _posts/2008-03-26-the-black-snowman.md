oooohhh it was snowing yesterday! Those sparkling soft snow was falling in the early morning when i was going to work. I mean spring is coming and of all times it has to snow now?? But i loved it!!! It's the first time I saw snow right in front of me and i walked through the falling snow as well... and then when i reached the rail tracks it looked even more pretty.

Now i'm really confused... do i want the Spring to come or more snow??Â Oh by the way, notice the big black snow man in the pic... maybe you should have worn that white jacket again to look like a proper snowman.

Seriously!! When will i stop looking like a big ball?? :P
