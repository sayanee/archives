a screenshot of a [typical french keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:French_pc_keyboard.svg): So you have to press Shift to type in the numerals. Apart from the commonly used shift key, Alt Gr is also used to type in different symbols and alphabets. Apart from this french keyboard, i learnt that there are even [more types of keyboards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout)!!
