It is interesting to note the lineage of the kings ruling the Indian lands during the mythological times. And i found some noted kings belonging to these dynasties:

- Solar Dynasty: Dasarath, Ram and Lav-Kush from the Ramayana
- Lunar Dynasty:Â Bhishma, Pandu, Dhritrashtra and Yudhishthira from the Mahabharata
