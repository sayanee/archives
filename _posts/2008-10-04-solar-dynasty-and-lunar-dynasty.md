In Hindu Mythology, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Dynasty">Solar Dynasty</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Dynasty">Lunar Dynasty</a> are the most famous and important. It is interesting to note the lineage of the kings ruling the Indian lands during the mythological times. And i found some noted kings belonging to these dynasties:
<ul>
	<li>Solar Dynasty: Dasarath, Ram and Lav-Kush from the Ramayana</li>
	<li>Lunar Dynasty:Â Bhishma, Pandu, Dhritrashtra and Yudhishthira from the Mahabharata</li>
</ul>
