<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

confident investor...
<ul>

	<li>you invest your money for long-term needs of 5 years or more</li>
	<li>reinvest the dividends is a way to increase the number of shares that you own without spending extra to buy them</li>

</ul>
companies...
<ul>
	<li>large-cap companies ($5b and higher): This tends to be where you find your 'blue-chip' companies. These are firms that have been around long enough and are established enough to have definitive market share, relatively stable profits, and often a history of paying dividends. The names of these firms are usually easily recognized and you probably useÂ their products and services in your daily life. Eg. Coca Cola, McDonalds, Ford, Wal-Mart</li>
	<li>Mid-cap Companies ($1b to $5b): You may recognise some of these companies' names as well, but as the name implies, these firms are a bit smaller than their larger counter parts</li>
	<li>Small-cap companies: (less than $1billion): There are a very small number of trades</li>
</ul>
Investment selection styles..
<ol>

	<li><strong>Momentum Investing:</strong> A subset of growth investing is momentum investing.</li>
	<li><strong>Value Investing:</strong>Value investing is opposite of growth. This takes patience and you have a to wait a fair bit of time to see the kinds of results</li>
</ol>
