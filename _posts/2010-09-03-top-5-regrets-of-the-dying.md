From the [original article](http://ezinearticles.com/?Top-Five-Regrets-of-the-Dying&id=3268063)...

1. I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
2. I wish I didn't work so hard.
3. I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.
