From the <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Top-Five-Regrets-of-the-Dying&amp;id=3268063">original article</a>...
<ol>
	<li>I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.</li>
	<li>I wish I didn't work so hard.</li>
	<li>I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.</li>
	<li>I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.</li>
	<li>I wish that I had let myself be happier.</li>
</ol>
