<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>2011</strong></span> was my happiest year to date. I travelled yet again for 20% of my time. More importantly, after years of not knowing, I finally dived into something I truly love - the world of design and development that turns you into purely a maker.

<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>2012</strong></span> will be a different year. I will be living by myself for the first time in my life. The scale of responsibility will go up, but this should also give me plenty of time to focus and experiment.

So this year I want to...

1. <del>make</del> code 10 things just for fun
1. contribute to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">online</a> <a href="https://github.com/">geek</a> <a href="http://forrst.com/">groups</a>
1. practice <a href="http://zenhabits.net/scarce/">minimalism</a>
1. travel to a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/seesv.html">new</a> continent
1. be a cooler <a href="http://wedding.chin.ee/">partner-in-crime for life</a>
