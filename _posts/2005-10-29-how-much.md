My [blog](http://sweska.blogspot.com/) is worth **$0.00**.

And ...

- Anand's Blog is $0.00
- Ogh's Blog is $0.00
- KT your 6-star blog is $0.00
- Elaine's blog is $1,693.62 !!!!!!!.... despite no dundee pics _\*\*sweska pouts\*\*_

WUH!!!!!......Elvin's blog is **$5,645.40**!!!!!!!!!... of course it'll be worth so much when he comes up with well-thought out theories like...

> **BLOGGING PROBABILITY.** Conceptualised Dr Elvin,

> BLOGGING PROBABILITY (P) = **Blogging Inclination(I)** X **Blog Action Potential(X)** X **Free Blog Time Fraction(t).**

Where,**Blogging Inclination (I)** = % Desire to blog over a scale from 0 to 1.

> **Blog Action Potential (X)** = Ability to convert your thoughts to action from a scale from 0 to 1. 1 being translating all thoughts to action.

**Free Blog Time Fraction(t)** = Hours of free time a week/ (Total hours a week x Hours spent per blog).
