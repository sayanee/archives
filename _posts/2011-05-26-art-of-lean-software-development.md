Running automated test
<blockquote>In Test First Development (TFD), the test for new or changed code is written before the implementing code. This means that,Â initially, the test will fail (because change hasn't yet been implemented), and the goal is to refine the application's code until the test succeeds.</blockquote>
Kinds of tests:
Unit Tests, Mocks &amp; Stubs, Integration tests, Behavior Tests, Executable specifications, Nonfunctional testing, User Interface Testing
