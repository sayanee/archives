I want this <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/lights/757e/">water powered clock</a>! Yes, really... this clock is powered by only water. Here's how...
<blockquote>The internal converter simply extracts electrons from water (or other liquid) molecules and provides a steady stream of electrical current acting as a fuel cell to generate power to the clock.</blockquote>
