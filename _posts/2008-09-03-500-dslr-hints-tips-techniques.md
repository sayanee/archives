<strong>Some extracts</strong>:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#33:</span> I have found most useful playback screen to be the highlights screen, which identifies areas of the image where the highlights (whites) have burned out beyond the dynamic range of the sensor.

#65: Eventually, all RAW files have to be converted into a more standard file type such as TIFF or JPEG. All RAW files have a proprietary extension (Nikon=NEF, Canon=CRW) which determines the code used when constructing a RAW file. Because this code is unique to a particular manufacturer, generally the file must be opened in that manufacturer’s proprietary software.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#63:</span> If image quality is less important than speed of delivery, then shoot JPEG. If the image quality is everything, then shoot RAW. If in doubt… shoot in RAW+JPEG mode.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#68:</span> Every time you resave a JPEG, it is further compressed. Eventually, if resaved over and over, there will be little left of the original data. If you plan on regularly processing the same image, then it is better to save the image as a TIFF image.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#132:</span> The focal length of the lens is the distance between its optical center and the focal point, which is indicated in mm and is related to the magnifying power of the elns.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#134:</span> Wide angle lenses have a focal length less than 36mm. … their effect is to expand the space between objects, making them appear further apart.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#135:</span> Telephoto lenses have a focal length greeter than 60mm…their effect is to compress the space between objects making them appear closer together.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#143:</span> FLMF: When people talk about focal length in terms of digital photography, they often refer to the focal length magnification factor (FLMF), or the focal length multiplier. In nutshell, any DSLR that isn’t “full frame” (i.e. has a sensor the same size as a 35mm film frame) will alter the picture angle of the lens, which gives the appearance of magnifying focal length. E.g. Nikon DSLT has a FLMF of 1.5x because its sensor is smaller than 35mm film frame. Therefore, a 28mm lens has an apparent focal length of 42mm.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#181:</span> Depth of field increases when small lens apertures are set (e.g. f/11, f/16); the subject is distant from the camera; wide angle lenses are used.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"># 182:</span> Depth of field reduces when any of the following apply: large lens aperture are set (eg. f/2, f/2.8, f/4); the subject is very close to the camera (e.g. macro); long telephoto lenses are used

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#190:</span> Warning! Never try manually ofcusing the lens when the camera/lens are set to AF, as it may damage the AF motors

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#207:</span> Aperture range. The paerture refers to the size of the hole in the diaphragm of the lens and is indicated by an f/stop number. Large f/stop numbers indicate a small aperture, and small f/stop numbers indicate a large aperture.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#224</span>: Use center-weighted metering mode for: formal portraits of people and animals, backlit subjects

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#230:</span> The sunny f/16 rule: When taking pictures in bright sunlight the high level of contrast can sometimes confuse a camera's internal meter. TO avoid inaccurate expisures in these conditions, set the lens aperture to f/16 and the shutter speed equivalent to the ISO-E rating.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">#475:</span> Next time you visit a hotel... take the complimentary shower cap from the bathroom with you. They make excellent, lgihtweight rain covers for digital cameras
