title: Find and Replace
---

Find and Replace function is a powerful tool. It can cut down many repeated replacement processes in word processing. Some replacements need not be character. For example, New Line Breaks or Spaces can also be replace.

In MS Word, I found this useful:

> Edit -> Replace -> More -> Special -> Paragraph Mark -> Replace With: `<space>`
