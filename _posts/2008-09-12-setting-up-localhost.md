I have been wanting to experiment with web designs et al and it is better to expriment on our desktop first before putting it up in the internet. Setting up a local server is really easy. [This post shows how to set up a local server with wordpress engine](http://geeksaresexy.blogspot.com/2006/06/installing-wordpress-locally-under.html) with [xampp.](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html)

So, while the local folders/roots folder will be in `C:\xampplite\htdocs`, when the internet browser is opened, the address will be `C:\localhost` E.g.`C:\xampplite\htdocs\wordpress` and in the browser: `C:\localhost\wordpress`.
