I have been wanting to experiment with web designs et al and it is better to expriment on our desktop first before putting it up in the internet. Setting up a local server is really easy. <a href="http://geeksaresexy.blogspot.com/2006/06/installing-wordpress-locally-under.html">This post shows how to set up a local server with wordpress engine</a> with <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html">xampp.</a>

So, while the local folders/roots folder will be in C:\xampplite\htdocs, when the internet browser is opened, the address will be C:\localhost\. E.g. C:\xampplite\htdocs\wordpress and in the browser: C:\localhost\wordpress.
