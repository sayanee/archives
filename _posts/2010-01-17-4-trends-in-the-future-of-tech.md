I truly believe that technology today is ultimately the manifestation of human imagination.  Man did think of flying in the past and look where we are now! We are living in an age where many of our pre-historic wild imagination of split second communication across thousand miles, knowing the billion year universe history and flying across the solar system nearer to the stars have come true. In essence, it's utterly magical !

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic - Carl Sagan
And today, we are living in an exciting age where man has come to build many "magical" toys like the internet, the airplane or the laptop. We are at an age where fundamental physics have been discovered and we are spending many efforts into refining and integrating many technologies, digging deeper into space and the atomic world to create even more breath-taking imagination of our mind.  The next 50 years will define and create many such integrated devices with faster updates, connectivity and intuitive humane functions and most importantly, it will come be to available to the people world-wide. The 4 important trends that I believe will propel the future of technology are:
1. Human sense integration
2. Data
3. Connectivity
4. People

![](/img/future-tech.jpg) **1. Human sense integration** Today, will much of the technology and the way we interact with machines is done in a mechanical way. Tomorrow, the human senses will define the technology. We will use more of our [gestures](/sixth-sense-by-pranav-mistry/), [touch](/10gui/) and voice to interact and send messages all across the world. And these information will be readily understood by any culture and any language. That would be very humane.  **2. Data **Today data is very much stored in our home within the hard disks, DVDs and storage devices. Tomorrow, data will be accessible from anywhere with super fast upload and download capabilities. It will be secure for private access and yet, common knowledge will be available to all for us.  **3. Connectivity **Some pockets of the world is cut of from the world wide web and mobile connections. The next huge phenomenon will be to make this connectivity available to anywhere in the world and anybody cheaply. Yes, that lone ship out in the middle of Pacific ocean, that adventurer in the Antarctic or little boy from remote village of Africa will be able to access the mobile and internet connectivity cheaply and readily.  **4. People **People, people, people... regardless of location, affordability or education - all will be able to tap into the shared knowledge of the world through internet and affordable gadgets. This is more of a socio-tech trend and many of us do not want to leave anybody else behind!  All of the trends that I have described are already implementable. The next task of the tech world will be to integrate, make it sleek, intuitive and super fast. Are you excited? I am :) Are you having wild thoughts on the next tech machine? I am and I want to doodle them and share it out soon!  Doodle, doodle, doodle...
