<p align="justify">I just had to post this beautiful photo taken ages ago in flim camera and developed by himself in his dark room... by dad. It was probably taken on the <a href="http://www.dighabeach.com/">beaches of Digha</a> because the waves seem so much gentler than the seas that directly overlook the Bay of Bengal. I love the way the graceful horse makes its way to the seeming horizon...</p>

<p align="justify">Ever since we brought back one of dad's black and white photo albums, i have been looking at them and restoring the torn edges and the discoloured parts. Wheee... he's simply excited to look at them like new ones!!</p>
