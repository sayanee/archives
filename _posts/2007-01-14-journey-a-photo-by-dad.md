I just had to post this beautiful photo taken ages ago in film camera and developed by himself in his dark room... by dad. It was probably taken on the [beaches of Digha](http://www.dighabeach.com/) because the waves seem so much gentler than the seas that directly overlook the Bay of Bengal. I love the way the graceful horse makes its way to the seeming horizon...

Ever since we brought back one of dad's black and white photo albums, i have been looking at them and restoring the torn edges and the discoloured parts. Wheee... he's simply excited to look at them like new ones!!
