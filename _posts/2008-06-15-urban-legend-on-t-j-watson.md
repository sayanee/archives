[Read this story a few times ](http://www.abc.net.au/catapult/indepth/s1330199.htm)here and there...

T. J. Watson, one of IBM's influential pioneer leaders had this talk with his employee (a highly efficient one) in 1915.

The employee probably did a big blunder that cost the company thousands of dollars. So when he came to meet Mr. Watson, he was naturally expecting to be fired.

But instead Mr. Watson said this, "You kidding me! We just send you for training costing thousands of dollars!"
