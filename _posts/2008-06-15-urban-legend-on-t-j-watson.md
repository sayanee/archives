<p style="padding-left: 30px;">T. J. Watson, one of IBM's influential pioneer leaders had this talk with his employee (a highly efficient one) in 1915.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The employee probably did a big blunder that cost the company thousands of dollars. So when he came to meet Mr. Watson, he was naturally expecting to be fired.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But instead Mr. Watson said this, "You kidding me! We just send you for training costing thousands of dollars!"</p>
