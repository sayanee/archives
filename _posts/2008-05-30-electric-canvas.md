I'm in love with this new art form that i saw - <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.theelectriccanvas.com.au/">Electric Canvas</a>. These artists transforms huge building facades into magnificent designs and themes using only light projections. Now talk about arts, physics and engineering all coming into play!
