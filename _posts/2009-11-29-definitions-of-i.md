I have been bumping into so many energetic and passionate people who know what they love and what they want and they are all doing it while having a lot of fun! It is making me very impatient .. actually _kan cheong_ is the right word.

I'm not going to seek out and go into the industry and then look for the _areas_ that suite me... no no no! Instead, I'm all set to find out exactly what **i want** , what **i love**,Â  and then steer myself towards that.

The areas have narrowed over the few years, but not yet! So i have started out with 9 words that sort of rings the bell **ME**!

Let's see how they will branch out or even change... over the months i hope to share what these 9 words mean to me and how i have explored them.

So what are the words that scream and connect to you? Any of them are similar to mine?? :D
