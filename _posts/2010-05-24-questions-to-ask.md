![](/img/question.jpg "question") Almost all the times, I'm realizing, the questions are more important than the answers.  [TED has some excellent food for thought](http://www.ted.com/registration/apply)...
1. If a friend were to describe your accomplishments in up to three sentences, what would he or she say?
2. What other achievements would you like to share?
3. What are you passionate about? (work, creative output, issues, communities…)
4. What do we need to know about you that we didn't ask? (Up to 300 words)
5. (Optional) Can you share a memorable anecdote from your life that will give us a further sense of what makes you tick?

And the other one I noticed, is the  [questionnaire from Sandbox](http://www.sandbox-network.com/join/)...
1. What is the next big thing you want to achieve?
2. List places and organisations you worked and studied at that shaped you as the person that you are today. Why?
3. Initiatives that you started or led, off the normal/regular track
4. About what topics should someone ask YOU?
5. Add five (or more) tags that describe you and your interests and passions (please separate with commas)
6. When you leave this world, what do you want to be remembered for?
7. When was the last time you did something for the first time? What was it?

Something is clicking in you already? I think it is for me ;)
