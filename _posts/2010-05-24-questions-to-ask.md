<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-693" title="question" src="/img/question.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />Almost all the times, I'm realizing, the questions are more important than the answers.

<a class="vt-p" href="http://www.ted.com/registration/apply">TED has some excellent food for thought</a>...
<ol>
	<li>If a friend were to describe your accomplishments in up to three sentences, what would he or she say?</li>
	<li>What other achievements would you like to share?</li>
	<li>What are you passionate about? (work, creative output, issues, communities…)</li>
	<li>What do we need to know about you that we didn't ask? (Up to 300 words)</li>
	<li>(Optional) Can you share a memorable anecdote from your life that will give us a further sense of what makes you tick?</li>
</ol>
And the other one I noticed, is the <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.sandbox-network.com/join/">questionnaire from Sandbox</a>...
<ol>
	<li>What is the next big thing you want to achieve?</li>
	<li>List places and organisations you worked and studied at that shaped you as the person that you are today. Why?</li>
	<li>Initiatives that you started or led, off the normal/regular track</li>
	<li>About what topics should someone ask YOU?</li>
	<li>Add five (or more) tags that describe you and your interests and passions (please separate with commas)</li>
	<li>When you leave this world, what do you want to be remembered for?</li>
	<li>When was the last time you did something for the first time? What was it?</li>
</ol>
Something is clicking in you already? I think it is for me ;)
