**Book Title:** 33 Killer Persuasion Tactics to Multiply Your Sales and Business **Author:** Stuart Tan **Year written/published:** 2006/2005 **My Comment:**Very focused manuscript on 33 tactics for persuasion. I really like this one! The author first goes on to explain the meaning of Influence before telling the reader about the 33 tactics. He dabbled a lot withÂ psychology and body language to go in depth about understanding the other party. And what i loved most is a table that displayed all the names of the 33 tatics and told us exactly in which stage of buying we can use them... very clear and concise! **Some extracts:** Here are some of the definitions/theories he mentioned:

1. Heuristics
2. [FUD Factor ](http://www.answers.com/topic/fud-factor)(Fear Uncertainty Doubt)
3. [WIIFM factor ](http://www.chacocanyon.com/pointlookout/030813.shtml)(What's In It For Me)
4. Recency and Primary Effect
5. SCORE (Symptom, Cause, Outcome desired, Resource required, Effect)
6. [Cialdini's Law of Persuasion](http://mediationmindset.blogspot.com/2007/02/negotiation-and-laws-of-persuasion.html)

The stages of buying process:
1. new/Resistant
2. Rapport
3. Open to persuasion
4. Recognition of Problem
5. Skeptical of Problem
6. Open to Solution
7. Desires the solution

And here's tactic #12: Reduce Resistance by getting a favour ( [Franklin Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_Effect)) I didn't know about this tactic before, so i'm mentioning it here... >  

> Benjamin Franklin himself said, "He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged".

> In fact, based on a situation that old Ben reported on, there is now a phenomenon known as the Franklin Effect, which states that enemies who do you a favour will be predisposed to doing more favours for you.
