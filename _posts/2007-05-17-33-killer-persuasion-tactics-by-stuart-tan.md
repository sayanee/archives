<p align="justify"><strong>Book Title:</strong> 33 Killer Persuasion Tactics to Multiply Your Sales and Business
<strong>Author:</strong> Stuart Tan
<strong>Year written/published:</strong> 2006/2005
<strong>My Comment:</strong>Very focused manuscript on 33 tactics for persuasion. I really like this one! The author first goes on to explain the meaning of Influence before telling the reader about the 33 tactics. He dabbled a lot withÂ psychology and body language to go in depth about understanding the other party. And what i loved most is a table that displayed all the names of the 33 tatics and told us exactly in which stage of buying we can use them... very clear and concise!
<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

Here are some of the definitions/theories he mentioned:
<ol>
	<li>Heuristics</li>

	<li><a href="http://mediationmindset.blogspot.com/2007/02/negotiation-and-laws-of-persuasion.html">Cialdini's Law of Persuasion</a></li>
</ol>
The stages of buying process:
<ol>
	<li>new/Resistant</li>
	<li>Rapport</li>
	<li>Open to persuasion</li>
	<li>Recognition of Problem</li>
	<li>Skeptical of Problem</li>
	<li>Open to Solution</li>
	<li>Desires the solution</li>
</ol>
And here's tactic #12: Reduce Resistance by getting a favour (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_Effect">Franklin Effect</a>) I didn't know about this tactic before, so i'm mentioning it here...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Benjamin Franklin himself said, "He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged".</p>
<p align="justify">In fact, based on a situation that old Ben reported on, there is now a phenomenon known as the Franklin Effect, which states that enemies who do you a favour will be predisposed to doing more favours for you.</p>
</blockquote>
