<p align="justify"><font color="#000099"><b>Happy hols pals!!!! </b></font>I mean all the best for exams...then happy hols...then New Year and new semester again. Next sem I realized a lot of people will be going for exchange and IA. It just striked me that I’ll be next seeing them in august 2006 when we’ll be in year 4! That’s like 8 months later… almost a year. Those of us still stuck in the campus will no longer have the same lectures, as we'll depart for different specializations. And for some with 3-year course it'll be their last semester in uni… probably the last 3 months of their education life as well!!</p>
<p align="justify">Keep in touch with old friends...treasure them. And yes make new friends too! I thought I was good at making new friends in a blink blink... I realized NO. I can take much long...much much long.... sigh. So what's the use of all my leadership training crap, cheering out loud, creating a lot of crap and noise when I can't even take a simple simple initiative? Useless...</p>
<p align="justify">And here's a friendship song for all of you!! Reminds me of myself... If only I could also... maybe one should just take the step before we part without a simple hi..</p>
