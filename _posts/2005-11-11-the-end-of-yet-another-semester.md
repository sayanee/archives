**Happy hols pals!!!!**

I mean all the best for exams...then happy hols...then New Year and new semester again. Next sem I realized a lot of people will be going for exchange and IA. It just striked me that I’ll be next seeing them in august 2006 when we’ll be in year 4! That’s like 8 months later… almost a year. Those of us still stuck in the campus will no longer have the same lectures, as we'll depart for different specializations. And for some with 3-year course it'll be their last semester in uni… probably the last 3 months of their education life as well!!
