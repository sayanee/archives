1. play it safe
1. know your limitations
1. remind yourself: it's just a job
1. be the tough guy to see that data
1. respect history
1. stop the madness before it can get started
1. been there, done that
1. keep your eyes closed
1. assume there is no problem
1. underestimate your customers
1. be a mentor. give sound advice to the people who work under you
1. be suspicious of the creatives in your organisation
1. when all else fails, act like a grown up
