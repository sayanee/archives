title: Plea for lean software
---
[Niklaus Wirth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth) takes an interesting view on while the hardware speed is growing, the softwares are becoming "fatter" - [A plea for lean software](http://d.linux-bg.org/download/docs/wirth.pdf) (pdf).

2 laws...

> With a touch of humor, the following two laws reflect the state of the art admirably well:
- Software expands to fill the available memory. (Parkinson)
- Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.(Reiser)

Clearly, two contributing factors to the acceptance of ever-growing software are

1. rapidly growing hardware performance and
1. customers' ignorance of features that are essential-versus-nice to have.

Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling-the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration.
