<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth">Niklaus Wirth</a> takes an interesting view on while the hardware speed is growing, the softwares are becoming "fatter" - <a href="http://d.linux-bg.org/download/docs/wirth.pdf">A plea for lean software</a> (pdf). Some quotes...

2 laws...
<blockquote>With a touch of humor, the following two laws reflect the state of the art admirably well:
-Software expands to fill the available memory. (Parkinson)
-Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.(Reiser)
</blockquote>
Clearly, two contributing factors to the acceptance of ever-growing software are
(1) rapidly growing hardware performance and
(2) customers' ignorance of features that are essential-versus-nice to have.

Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling-the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration.
