The person of the day goesÂ to the _panwalla_.

So dad was craving for _mitha pan_... sweet betal leaves after a sumptuous lunch. And the panwalla prepared them with 10 over spices and explained it all to us. I haven't tasted these pan for a long while it seems!

Cost of the pan: 24 rupees for 8 pan

Cost of the taste: priceless!
