And so, she has her VISA as well. In the midst of all the rush-rush, there was simply no time to celebrate my parents' 30th anniversary!! But, now it looks like we can only celebrate it somewhere else. I cannot believe that [merely within 2 years](http://sweska.net/2005/12/02/my-responsibilities/), dad's unimaginable wish to travel to Europe will come true real soon... well if I can plan it all real well. So where would you both want to have that pending dinner? Along the Champs Élysées, at the Grande Place or on top of Aiguille du midi? :D

See you soon mom and dad... see you in Paris!! I will make it come true. Start packing too!!!!!!!
