<p>another poem about CAN! I love the energy felt in this poem!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you think you are beaten, you are;<br />
if you think  you dare not, you don't;<br />
if you like to win, but you think you can't<br />
it's almost a cinch you won't.</p>
<p>If you think you'll lose, you've lost;<br />
for out in the world we find<br />
success begins with a fellow's Will~<br />
it's all in the state of mind.</p>
<p>Ii you think you are outclassed, you are;<br />
you've got to think high to rise.<br />
You've just got to be sure of yourself<br />
before you can win the prize.</p>
<p><font color="#800000">Life's battles don't always go<br />
to the stronger or faster man,<br />
but sooner or later the man who wins<br />
is the one who thinks he can.</font></p></blockquote>
