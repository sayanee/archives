another poem about CAN! I love the energy felt in this poem!

>

> If you think you are beaten, you are;
if you think  you dare not, you don't;
if you like to win, but you think you can't
it's almost a cinch you won't.

> If you think you'll lose, you've lost;
for out in the world we find
success begins with a fellow's Will~
it's all in the state of mind.

> Ii you think you are outclassed, you are;
you've got to think high to rise.
You've just got to be sure of yourself
before you can win the prize.

> Life's battles don't always go
to the stronger or faster man,
but sooner or later the man who wins
is the one who thinks he can.
