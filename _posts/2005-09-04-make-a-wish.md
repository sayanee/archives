<p align="justify">I jogged alone today again! Where are my fitness partners?? All are busy busy busy. Jogging was so lonely even with the loud music of the mp3 player. When the song stops you can hear yourself breathe so hard…as if you can hear what your heart speaks when there is complete silence. I listened hard…and kept jogging.</p>
<p align="justify">The leaves were falling due to strong breeze and I caught a falling leaf! I made a wish…I wished …I wished…and I somehow feel that it’ll come true.Make a wish…whenever you can. There are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1128237">many ways </a>as to how u can wish…but the most important thing is to believe.</p>
