I have finally mustered up enough motivation to run a measely 4km... and i'm wondering how to jog and carry a water bottle and house key and also the bus card (for cheating purposes) all together while running.

Tomorrow i shall attempt to walk  jog 10km!!! how to run like that on sunday?? I have never been a runner, but i know i'll definitely finish the entire route! But first up... the trial 10km run!
