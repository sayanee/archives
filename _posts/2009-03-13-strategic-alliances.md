<strong>Book Title</strong>: Harvard Business Review on Strategic Alliances
<strong> Author</strong>:-
<strong> Year written/published</strong>: 2002
<strong> Book Source</strong>: Google Books, Library
<strong> Some extracts</strong>:

Competitive collaboration adhere to a set of simple but powerful principles:
<ul>
	<li>Collaboration is competition in a different form</li>
	<li>Harmony is not the most important measure of success</li>
	<li>Cooperation has limits. Companies must defend against competitive compromise</li>
	<li>Leaning from partners is paramount</li>
</ul>
Avoiding self-deception:
<ul>
	<li>We’re better off partnering with X than competing against it in our core business</li>
	<li>By joining forces with another second tier company, we can create a strong company while fixing our problems together</li>
	<li>We need a strong partner to improve skills</li>
	<li>by partnering with another company in our industry, we can access its new products and technologies while minimizing our investments in core products and technologies</li>
	<li>We can use an alliance to raise capital without giving up management control</li>
</ul>
6 types of alliances:
<ol>
	<li>Collision between competitors</li>
	<li>alliances of the weak</li>
	<li>disguised sales</li>
	<li>bootstrap alliances</li>
	<li>evolutions to a sale</li>
	<li>alliances of complementary equals</li>
</ol>
some lessons learnt:
<ul>
	<li>Groups are only as strong as the alliances within them: manage individual relationships carefully</li>
	<li>Effective groups are worth more than the sum of the alliances within them: manage the group as a whole</li>
	<li>the sky is not the limit in alliance groups: expand with caution where you sit in which network determines what you get: position your company strategically within and among alliance groups</li>
	<li>a lack of commitment is the flip side of flexibility: be sure that the network strategy is sustainable for your company</li>
</ul>
