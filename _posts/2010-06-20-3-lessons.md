After a month long stay in Slovenia, I'm heading towards Austria today.

It is not travelling until you meet the locals, stay in hostels and pair up for hikes, engage in working and pig out on the regional delicacies! Just like [my previous travels](/hopping-around-again/), this was too a life defining moment for me! As I continue on my journey, there are 3 lessons I would like to share...

**Fill my mind with foods for thought**... keep reading, keep meeting people and keep doodling ideas!

**Keep my feet grounded** ... be humble, listen more and be non-judgmental towards people

**Wear my shoes and keep playing**... jump into new experiences, stretch to explore bolder projects, and find crazy partners who are willing to do this with me!

Good Bye Slovenia... for the lovely memories!
