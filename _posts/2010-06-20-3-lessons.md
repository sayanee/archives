<p style="text-align: left;">After a month long stay in Slovenia, I'm heading towards Austria today.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is not travelling until you meet the locals, stay in hostels and pair up for hikes, engage in working and pig out on the regional delicacies! Just like <a class="vt-p" href="/hopping-around-again/">my previous travels</a>, this was too a life defining moment for me! As I continue on my journey, there are 3 lessons I would like to share...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-698" src="/img/3lessons.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #993366;">Fill my mind with foods for thought</span></strong>... keep reading, keep meeting people and keep doodling ideas!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Keep my feet grounded</span></strong> ... be humble, listen more and be non-judgmental towards people</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wear my shoes and keep playing</span></strong></span>... jump into new experiences, stretch to explore bolder projects, and find crazy partners who are willing to do this with me!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Good Bye Slovenia... for the lovely memories!</p>
