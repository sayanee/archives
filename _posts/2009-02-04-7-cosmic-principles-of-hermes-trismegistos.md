i came across this another spiritual principles from ancient times... and<a href="http://youcreatereality.com/blog/index.php/2008/06/the-seven-cosmic-principles-of-hermes-trismegistos-hermetic-laws/"> this article summarises it beautifully</a>.
<ol>
	<li><strong>The Principle of Mentalism (MIND) </strong>
“THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental.”</li>
	<li><strong>The Principle of Cause and Effect (KARMA)</strong>
“Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happensaccording to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there aremany planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law.”</li>
	<li><strong>The Principle of Correspondence (ANALOGY)</strong>
“As above, so below; as below, so above.”</li>
	<li><strong>The Principle of Rhythm</strong>
“Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.”</li>
	<li><strong>The Principle of Gender</strong>
“Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes.”</li>
	<li><strong>The Principle of Vibration</strong>
“Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.” </li>
	<li><strong>The Principle of Polarity (DUALITY)</strong>
“Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature,but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.”</li>
</ol>
