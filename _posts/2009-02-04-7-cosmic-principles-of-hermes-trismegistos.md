title: 7 Cosmic Principles of Hermes Trismegistos
---

i came across this another spiritual principles from ancient times... and [ this article summarises it beautifully](http://youcreatereality.com/blog/index.php/2008/06/the-seven-cosmic-principles-of-hermes-trismegistos-hermetic-laws/).

1. **The Principle of Mentalism (MIND) ** “THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental.”
2. **The Principle of Cause and Effect (KARMA)** “Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happensaccording to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there aremany planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law.”
3. **The Principle of Correspondence (ANALOGY)** “As above, so below; as below, so above.”
4. **The Principle of Rhythm** “Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.”
5. **The Principle of Gender** “Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes.”
6. **The Principle of Vibration** “Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.” 
7. **The Principle of Polarity (DUALITY)** “Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature,but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.”
