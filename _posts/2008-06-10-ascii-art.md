I just discovered a genre of art form - creating pictures with ASCII characters! yes i have seen bits and pieces of them, but i never knew there is such a serious art form - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII ART</a>! And one of my fav ASCII art has to be from <a href="http://www.chris.com/ascii/">Chris</a>!
