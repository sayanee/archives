I just discovered a genre of art form - creating pictures with ASCII characters! yes i have seen bits and pieces of them, but i never knew there is such a serious art form - [ASCII ART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art)!

And one of my fav ASCII art has to be from [Chris](http://www.chris.com/ascii/)!
