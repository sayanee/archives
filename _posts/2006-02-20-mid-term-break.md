<p align="justify">…and the first day spent in school from <font color="#990033">9 am to 7pm </font>for only one module haha! But I’m glad to finally see the joy in their eyes after 1 week at 445pm! It was all because of a 3 line of code!!!! This is <font color="#000099">debugging</font>! My most nerve-racking semester is gonna go into full swing in a week’s time. My most challenging semester...Because I am taking 3 <font color="#003399">level 3000 </font>modules
Because for the first time I got <font color="#330099">5 days a week</font> timetable when I always had 4 days a week timetable
Because I have this really challenging project to build a <font color="#cc0066">remote controlled amphibious vehicle
</font>Because my timetable is totally bad bad bad with 2 days out of 5 days having only an hour lesson
Because for the first time I have a 4 hour LONELY break
<p align="justify">But hey!! C’mon there are some <font color="#663300">brighter things</font> to look at...</p>
<p align="justify">Because those lonely breaks are not really lonely when from now on you’ll have to spend it with your group mates in lab debugging!</p>
<p align="justify">Because it seems that I have given back a glimpse of my dad’s hobby to him. Dad is excited about the RC vehicle project. His hobby was aero-modelling... ok it’s not <em>was</em> because one day I’ll give it back to him. It seems like he sees himself in me when I was making the vehicle... haha! He remarked to me: “Nowadays education is so interesting...your hobby is your study”...bleah. Dad it’s not so interesting when there’s the stress of grading!</p>
<p align="justify">Because taking a <font color="#660000">GEM </font>is a breather. I like taking science GEMS...you just relax and go to lecture understanding everything the prof lectures on and you just enjoy. You can do all the tutorials because you happen to have a little help from a past semester student! Thanks Alvin! And sometimes you just discover more than science, maths and equations...</p>
<p align="justify">For example the <font color="#000099">Euler equation</font>...used it so many times thanks to CC Ko and signals.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/g.jpg" /></p>
<p align="justify">But hey let’s re-arrange the equation and what you get is this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/b.jpg" /></p>
<p align="justify">The universe’s 5 most fundamental elements – e, pi, i, 1 and 0. All adds up to absolutely NOTHING... ZERO.</p>
<p align="justify">How easily everything adds up to <strong><font color="#660066">nothing</font></strong>. And yet nothing is <strong><font color="#003366">everything</font></strong>...</p>
