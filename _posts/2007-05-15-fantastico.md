I wanted to install the wordpress in my own domain. And guess what! It was just a click of a button away thanks to Fantastico. [Fantastico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastico_%28web_hosting%29) can be found in the cPanel and it automates the installation of many web-based applications like Wordpress. It is [a product of Netenberg](http://netenberg.com/fantastico.php). And some applications that it can install are:

1. Blogs ( [Nucleus](http://nucleuscms.org/),  [pMachine Free](http://www.pmachine.com/ ),  [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ ))
2. Content Management ( [Geeklog](http://www.geeklog.net/ ),  [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/ ),  [phpWCMS](http://www.phpwcms.de/ ),  [phpWebSite](http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/ ),  [Post-Nuke](http://www.postnuke.com/ ),  [Siteframe](http://siteframe.org/ )) 
3. Discussion boards ( [SMF](http://www.simplemachines.org/ ))
4. Guest Book ( [ViPER Guestbook](http://www.vipergb.de.vu/ ))
5. FAQ ( [FAQMasterFlex](http://www.technetguru.net/design/faqmasterflex.php))
6. Image Gallaries ( [4Images Gallery](http://www.4homepages.de/ ))
7. Polls and Surveys ( [Advanced Poll](http://www.proxy2.de/scripts.php ),  [phpESP](http://phpesp.sourceforge.net/ ),  [PHPSurveyor](http://www.phpsurveyor.org/))
8. Wiki ( [PhpWiki](http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/ ))

And along with knowing how to use Fantastico, i also learnt the names of many other common applications. No wonder i often see people changing and adding so many things into their website... i always wondered how they did it so quickly and easily. it must be this easy! Now i know how they do it all ;)
