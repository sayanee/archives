When a verb in the participle form is used as an adjective, it is called a **participial adjective.** There are [2 forms of participial adjectives](http://www.grammar-quizzes.com/passive3a.html):

1. **-ing **(present participle): cause of the feeling. Â E.g. The drink was refreshing.
2. **-ed** (past participle): receiver of the feeling. E.g. I feel refreshed.
