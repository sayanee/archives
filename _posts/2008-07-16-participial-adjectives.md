When a verb in the participle form is used as an adjective, it is called a <strong>participial adjective.</strong>

There are <a href="http://www.grammar-quizzes.com/passive3a.html">2 forms of participial adjectives</a>:
<ol>
	<li><strong>-ing </strong>(present participle): cause of the feeling. Â E.g. The drink was refreshing.</li>
	<li><strong>-ed</strong> (past participle): receiver of the feeling. E.g. I feel refreshed.</li>
</ol>
