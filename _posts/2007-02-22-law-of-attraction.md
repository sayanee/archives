Want to know the secret of getting exactly what you always want?? 

Do you believe in the [law of attraction](http://law-of-attraction-info.com/)? If you truly focus, believe and visualise about the things you really want, you actually eventually get them! Wow! how wonderful!

_Why can't i have a car? Why can't i stay in a high rise flat? Why can't i wear branded clothes? Why can't i have a balcony? Why can't i travel back home all the time like all my friends? Why can't i go for more shopping? Why can't i have new shoes? Why is my boss is demanding and unreasonable? Why can't i have more money? Why are people always speaking bad about me? Why is my mother-in-law always talking behind my back? Why are my kids so irritating? Why can't i have a house?_

Well, the law of attraction says that YOU asked for every single minute of unhappiness in your life... we actually attract what we always think about! Read some of the beautiful quotations...
