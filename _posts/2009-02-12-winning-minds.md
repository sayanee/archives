<strong> Some extracts:</strong>

Asking the simple questions...
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">When I was about 10 years old I had a school book about math. The introduction explained that when we are young we ask big, simple questions: why is the sky blue? Why is water wet? Why do trees have leaves? As we grow older, we ask more detailed and complex questions. But some people go on asking the big, simple questions. We call these people Great scientists.
Itâ€™s the same in the world of business. Most of us spend our working lives on details, in small parts of the organisation and on short-term projects. Which is fine, but the management high-flyers - the future leaders 0 are the ones who never lose sight of the abiding principles, the wider pictures and the ultimate objectives of their organisation.
