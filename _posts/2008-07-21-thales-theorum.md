<a class="vt-p" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales'_theorem">Thales' theorem</a> states that if A, B and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Thales' theorem is a special case of the inscribed angle theorem.

The converse of Thales' theorem is also valid; it states that a right triangle's hypotenuse is a diameter of its circumcircle.
