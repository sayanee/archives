saw this in the Book by Dale Carnegie… Just for today…

1. Just for today I will be happy. This assumes that what Abraham Lincoln said is true, that ‘most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.’ Happiness is from within; it is not a matter of externals.
2. Just for today I will try to adjust myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my family, my business and my luck as they come and fit myself to them.
3. Just for today I will take care of my body. I will exercise it, care for it, nourish it, not abuse it nor neglect it so that it will be a perfect machine for my bidding.
4. Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration.
5. Just for today I will exercise my soul in 3 ways: I will do somebody good turn and not get found out. I will do 2 things that i don’t want to do
6. Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress as becomingly as possible, talk low act courteously, be liberal with praise, criticise not at all, nor find fault with anything and not try to regulate nor improve anyone.
7. Just for today I will try to live through this day only, not to tackle my whole life problem at once. I can do things for 12 hours that would appall me if I had to keep them up for a lifetime.
8. Just for today I will have a program. I will write it down what i expect to do every hour. I may not follow it exactly, but i will have it.
9. Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. In this half hour sometimes i will think of God, so as to get a little more perspective into my life
10. Just for today i will be unafraid, especially I will not be afraid to be happy, to enjoy what is beautiful, to love and to believe that those i love, love me.
