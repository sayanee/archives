<p align="justify">I like this song with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/teddygeiger/foryouiwillconfidence.html" title="For You I Will (Confidence) - Teddy Geiger">it's lyrics</a> and all. And it means something to me. I was thinking about leaving school in about a years' time and the many people that have crossed my path as i have walked along and the corners of this pretty huge campus. The unfeeling buildings of <a href="/2005/11/17/walking-into-those-good-ol-days/">my primary school</a> or <a href="/2006/07/28/visiting-alma-mater/">my secondary school</a> did leave an impression on me. Now this university is pretty big... can't feel for every corner here and there. But i'll definitely this remember this corridor...</p>

<p align="justify">I Can't help it. I got an affinity towards the unknown and the unfeeling like buildings and passers-by... holding on to something i have never known and don't think will ever get any chance to know any more. It's been too long. I wish i could let go. I don't have a humongous bunch of new pals here and it's ok because it was my decision not to join any activities. So in the end i don't have much to feel sad for this place and its people. And yet, i'm gonna miss something terribly because it has been a part of me.</p>
<p align="justify">Last chance to know some thing that i should know. One more year... or rather 34 more gruelling weeks.</p>
