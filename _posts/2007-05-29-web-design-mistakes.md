loved this <a href="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/43-web-design-mistakes-you-should-avoid/">handy list </a>right here... there are 43 of them! And here are some of the few I always believed were mistakes in web designs....
<ul>
	<li>don't make links open to new browser windows</li>
	<li>don't overuse flash</li>
	<li>don't start playing music automatically - let the user start</li>
	<li>if u are linking to pdf files disclose it</li>
	<li>no pop-ups</li>
	<li>no horizontal scrolling</li>
</ul>
