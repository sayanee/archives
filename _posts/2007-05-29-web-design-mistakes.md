loved this [handy list ](http://www.dailyblogtips.com/43-web-design-mistakes-you-should-avoid/)right here... there are 43 of them! And here are some of the few I always believed were mistakes in web designs....

- don't make links open to new browser windows
- don't overuse flash
- don't start playing music automatically - let the user start
- if u are linking to pdf files disclose it
- no pop-ups
- no horizontal scrolling
