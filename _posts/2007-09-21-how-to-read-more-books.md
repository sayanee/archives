i found this article basically summarises <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/08/06/how-to-read-70-books-in-a-year/">how to read 70+ books in a year</a>. I found it really true especially step 2 and step 4 where i basically read only when i'm travelling for the 2+ hours each day. Here are the steps...
<ol>
	<li>Learn to Speed Read</li>
	<li>Always Have a Book</li>
	<li>One Book at a Time</li>
	<li>Fill Gap Time With Reading</li>
	<li>Cut the Television and Web-Surfing</li>
	<li>Keep a To-Read List</li>
</ol>
