title: how to read more books
---

i found this article basically summarises [how to read 70+ books in a year](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/08/06/how-to-read-70-books-in-a-year/). I found it really true especially step 2 and step 4 where i basically read only when i'm travelling for the 2+ hours each day. Here are the steps...

1. Learn to Speed Read
2. Always Have a Book
3. One Book at a Time
4. Fill Gap Time With Reading
5. Cut the Television and Web-Surfing
6. Keep a To-Read List
