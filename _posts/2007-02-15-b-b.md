<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><strong>Bui bui</strong></font> is sweska. That's what i am called at home.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><strong>Bui bui</strong></font> came from the words that i first learnt to mumble from my mouth when i was really a baby. Since then, more than 2 decades have passed and well, i have forgotten to learn some thing new every other day.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://share.sweska.net/">Bui bui Blabbers</a> is thus created and i'll be posting up something new every day. Some thing that i have always loved, some thing that i never knew, some thing little and some thing that i want to know.</p>
<p align="justify">And on top on that i'm expanding my reading list. I'm gonna read a new book every 3 days :P <a href="http://share.sweska.net/category/book-reviews/">Look out for it</a>!</p>
<p align="justify">Life is short... i have decided that i'm not gonna sit and tell myself i dunno this and that. I need to know a lot more to drive myself along the path that i truly love. And that will be my destiny. Talking about destiny, I just got reminded about the beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu">urdu</a> lines that dev told us. It's written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allama_Iqbal">Muhamed Iqbal</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><em>Khudi ko kar buland itna ke har taqdeer se pehle
Khuda bande se khud pooche, bataa teri razaa kya hai?</em>

<p align="justify">Raise yourself to such greater heights that before writing your fate
God asks you himself, tell me how should I write your destiny? </blockquote>
