**Bui bui** is sweska. That's what i am called at home.

**Bui bui** came from the words that i first learnt to mumble from my mouth when i was really a baby. Since then, more than 2 decades have passed and well, i have forgotten to learn some thing new every other day.

[Bui bui Blabbers](http://share.sweska.net/) is thus created and i'll be posting up something new every day. Some thing that i have always loved, some thing that i never knew, some thing little and some thing that i want to know.

And on top on that i'm expanding my reading list. I'm gonna read a new book every 3 days :P [Look out for it](http://share.sweska.net/category/book-reviews/)!

Life is short... i have decided that i'm not gonna sit and tell myself i dunno this and that. I need to know a lot more to drive myself along the path that i truly love. And that will be my destiny. Talking about destiny, I just got reminded about the beautiful [urdu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu) lines that dev told us. It's written by [Muhamed Iqbal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allama_Iqbal)...

> _Khudi ko kar buland itna ke har taqdeer se pehle Khuda bande se khud pooche, bataa teri razaa kya hai?_

> Raise yourself to such greater heights that before writing your fate God asks you himself, tell me how should I write your destiny?
