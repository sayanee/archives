<p align="justify">Another classic problem solving question - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">Konigsberg Bridge</a>! To put it simply: People tried to find a way to walk all seven bridges without crossing a bridge twice, but no one could find a way to do it... until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Euler </a>came to explain why! And his analysis on this problem was the first of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph Theory</a> - of vertices, edges and faces.</p>

And Euler concluded that it was not possible to cross the bridges only once. Euler general law states: A path traversing the network of crossing every segment once is possible if the network is connected and has at most 2 vertices with odd valence (number of edge ends at the vertex).Â
