<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_of_Blood_speech">Rivers of Blood</a> is a speech by Enoch Powell, a Conservative Member of Parliament, who made this speech in 1968. This speech is one of the most controversial ones and it talks about the huge influx of immigrants and its implications to Britain. 

The <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/11/06/do0607.xml&amp;page=1">full text of the speech is found here</a>. Some extracts of the speech...
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 15 or 20 years, on present trends, there will be in this country three and a half million Commonwealth immigrants and their descendants. That is not my figure. That is the official figure given to parliament by the spokesman of the Registrar General's Office.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no comparable official figure for the year 2000, but it must be in the region of five to seven million, approximately one-tenth of the whole population, and approaching that of Greater London. Of course, it will not be evenly distributed from Margate to Aberystwyth and from Penzance to Aberdeen. Whole areas, towns and parts of towns across England will be occupied by sections of the immigrant and immigrant-descended population.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">... The natural and rational first question with a nation confronted by such a prospect is to ask: "How can its dimensions be reduced?" </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">... The answers to the simple and rational question are equally simple and rational: by stopping, or virtually stopping, further inflow, and by promoting the maximum outflow. Both answers are part of the official policy of the Conservative Party.</p>
