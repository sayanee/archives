> Look to this day! For it is life, the very life of life. In its brief course Lie all the verities and realities of your existence: The bliss of growth The glory of action The splendour of beauty For yesterday is but a dream And tomorrow only a vision But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness And every tomorrow a vision of hope. Look well, therefore to this day! Such is the salutation to the dawn.
