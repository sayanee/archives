Ever since I wrote a [n essay on Open Community](http://www.scribd.com/doc/31497904/Open-Communities-The-Future-of-Connecting), I have been more and more acquainted with conversations and ideas on the possibilities of "openness"... and it undoubtedly _opens_ up a whole new world. Some versions of open look tremendously exciting, while they seem unsustainable at the present, other open models seems like a pandora's box if unregulated... or is it?

What kinds of _open_ are you aware of and support zealously? Is everything open always good?
