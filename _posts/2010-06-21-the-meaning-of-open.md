<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since I wrote a<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/31497904/Open-Communities-The-Future-of-Connecting">n essay on Open Community</a>, I have been more and more acquainted with conversations and ideas on the possibilities of "openness"... and it undoubtedly <em>opens</em> up a whole new world. Some versions of open look tremendously exciting, while they seem unsustainable at the present, other open models seems like a pandora's box if unregulated... or is it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What kinds of <em>open</em> are you aware of and support zealously? Is everything open always good?</p>
