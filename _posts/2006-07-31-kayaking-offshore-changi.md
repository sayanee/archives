<p align="justify">After <a target="_blank" href="/2006/05/27/mixed-adventure/">my 2 star experience</a>... here comes my 3 star training.</p>
<p align="justify">The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scf.org.sg/Awards/Personal3.html">3 star syllabus</a> is challenging and you realise that you are no longer a novice kayaker struggling to keep your kayak straight. Every stroke demands some kind of tilting or edging the kayak. You also discover a new group a muscles that are aching... the torso muscles because you keep using them and the knees to edge the kayak. Capsize drill is such a norm that you can comfortably stay under water and overturned. But most importantly even if you complete this training course, it doesn't mean that you are a certified 3 star kayaker. You have an assessment!!!!!!</p>

So, here's a short revision on the stuff i learnt in 3 star:
New gears used: goggles + nose clip
New skills to learn: <a target="_blank" href="http://gorp.away.com/gorp/publishers/menasha/pad_bomb.htm">Eskimo roll</a>
New Strokes: hanging draw, sculling draw, draw on the move
New survival skills: towing, eskimo rescue
<p align="justify">Of all the skills, i feel the Eskimo roll is the most challenging. Actually, i was really dejected yesterday. I simply couldn't come up during the Eskimo roll. I capsized over 30 times ...so many times, orientated myself under water, my partner helped me guide the paddle... still cannot. But then my instructors showedÂ us the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scf.org.sg/Awards/Personal4S.html">4 star requirement</a> and a video about it. I was inspired. I want to do what they showed me in the video... i want to surf the waves of the sea with the rougher waves... with the gush of the choppy waters all around me.</p>
<p align="justify">But first... hope i can blog an entry the day i can do the Eskimo roll! My instructor took 6 months to do it... i hope i also can one day!! So i left the club with an uplifted mood :D It was late and the sun was about to set along the Changi beach. So the sky colour as you can see was changing fast. I tried to catch all the shades...</p>

Uhhh... what a way to end my 3 star training. Hope i can pass the assessment one day!
