About 2 years back, i discovered another world of free content - podcast!! And now subscribing through iTunes and watching them at almost every other free time makes me very very happy! Over time, i  started subscribing at an enormous rate and i was never able to finish listening to all of them. Hence, achieving Inbox 0 is heaven for my humongous list of 30+ podcast. A few days ago, i had over **1000+ unwatched podcasts** and i finally decided to delete all the past episodes and now it is  down to just a manageable weekly podcast dose of** 53 podcasts**, 18 hours :D Eliminating digital junk felt that good! I love watching and listening to podcasts downloaded from iTunes and synced to my iPhone. It always makes me a very patient person - I'm never out of things to do with a list of unwatched podcasts right in my iPhone! If friends ever wonder why i do not have any games in my iPhone, the culprit is podcast :D So i  thought of having an overview to what i generally listen to and divided them into 5 neat group...

**Tech** forms the biggest group with podcasts like [CommandN](http://feeds.feedburner.com/commandN_pod), [MacBreak](http://http://feeds.pixelcorps.com/feeds/macbreakipod.xml), [Tekzilla](http://revision3.com/tekzilla/feed/quicktime-large/) and our dear own [Tech65](http://www.tech65.org/category/podcast/feed). **Fun + Ideas **is the next big group and i love injecting random freshness of various thoughts and conversation through [TED](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TEDTalks_video), [Ignite](http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/igniteshow), [Do](The Do Lectures Let the Doers of the world inspire the rest of us. http://thedolectures.co.uk/media/site/podcast/feed.rss) lectures and [Rick Steve's Travel podcast](http://podcasts.ricksteves.com/video_itunes.xml). **Design podcasts** have a series of short video tutorials like [photoshop killer tips](http://www.kelbytv.com/photoshopkillertips/podcast/) and [pixelperfect](http://http://revision3.com/pixelperfect/feed/quicktime-large/) by Bert Monroy! Under **Biz +Finance **is have another range of podcasts from the [Welch Way](http://www.businessweek.com/search/podcasts/welchway.rss) to the [Sales' Guys QDT](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/xml/sales.xml). And finally, the **Quick Tips** group has few podcasts from the [QDT](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com) and Howcast networks. So you can see why i am never really bored... coz i'm always on the go with some content to listen to and wonder. Do you listen to podcasts as well?
