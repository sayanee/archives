About 2 years back, i discovered another world of free content - podcast!! And now subscribing through iTunes and watching them at almost every other free time makes me very very happy! Over time, i  started subscribing at an enormous rate and i was never able to finish listening to all of them.

Hence, achieving Inbox 0 is heaven for my humongous list of 30+ podcast. A few days ago, i had over <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>1000+ unwatched podcasts</strong></span> and i finally decided to delete all the past episodes and now it is  down to just a manageable weekly podcast dose of<strong> <span style="color: #008080;">53 podcasts</span></strong>, 18 hours :D Eliminating digital junk felt that good!

I love watching and listening to podcasts downloaded from iTunes and synced to my iPhone. It always makes me a very patient person - I'm never out of things to do with a list of unwatched podcasts right in my iPhone! If friends ever wonder why i do not have any games in my iPhone, the culprit is podcast :D So i  thought of having an overview to what i generally listen to and divided them into 5 neat group...
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-550  aligncenter" src="/img/iTunes-pie.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Tech</strong></span> forms the biggest group with podcasts like <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/commandN_pod">CommandN</a>, <a href="http://http://feeds.pixelcorps.com/feeds/macbreakipod.xml">MacBreak</a>, <a href="http://revision3.com/tekzilla/feed/quicktime-large/">Tekzilla</a> and our dear own <a href="http://www.tech65.org/category/podcast/feed">Tech65</a>.<strong><span style="color: #800000;">
</span></strong>

<strong><span style="color: #800000;">Fun + Ideas </span></strong>is the next big group and i love injecting random freshness of various thoughts and conversation through <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TEDTalks_video">TED</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/igniteshow">Ignite</a>, <a href="The Do Lectures				Let the Doers of the world inspire the rest of us.	http://thedolectures.co.uk/media/site/podcast/feed.rss">Do</a> lectures and <a href="http://podcasts.ricksteves.com/video_itunes.xml">Rick Steve's Travel podcast</a>.
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> </strong></span>

<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Design podcasts</strong></span> have a series of short video tutorials like <a href="http://www.kelbytv.com/photoshopkillertips/podcast/">photoshop killer tips</a> and <a href="http://http://revision3.com/pixelperfect/feed/quicktime-large/">pixelperfect</a> by Bert Monroy!

Under <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Biz +Finance </strong></span>is have another range of podcasts from the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/search/podcasts/welchway.rss">Welch Way</a> to the <a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/xml/sales.xml">Sales' Guys QDT</a>.

And finally, the <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Quick Tips</strong></span> group has few podcasts from the <a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com">QDT</a> and Howcast networks.

So you can see why i am never really bored... coz i'm always on the go with some content to listen to and wonder. Do you listen to podcasts as well?
