title: who helped Disney build the Disneyland??
---

A retired WWII U.S. Navy Admiral [Joe Fowler ](http://www.disneylandtoday.com/Legends/jfowler.htm)was especially invited by Walt Disney in 1954 to built and supervisor the construction of the Disneyland. A veteran of both the World Wars, after retirement he joined the Walt Disney Productions in 1954. Isn't it amazing how Fowler has been deeply involvedÂ in 2 very opposite and different spectrums of life - war and fun.
