<p align="justify">Public listed companies' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_report">annual reports</a> are found freely on their websites for their shareholders and they can be pretty long, but i found that browsing through gave an immence view about business and finances. There must surely be a better way to analyse them...</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.moneychimp.com/articles/financials/fundamentals.htm">article 1</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.zpub.com/sf/arl/arl-read.html">article 2</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.blonnet.com/iw/2007/07/08/stories/2007070850701300.htm">article 3</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jobfunctions.bnet.com/whitepaper.aspx?docid=58574">article 4</a></li>
</ul>
and a report usually has the following parts...
<ol>
	<li>Chairman's letter</li>
	<li>Stock history</li>
	<li>Financial Statements - Balance sheet, Income Statement</li>
	<li>Products of the Company</li>
	<li>Competitive Analysis</li>
</ol>
