Public listed companies' [annual reports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_report) are found freely on their websites for their shareholders and they can be pretty long, but i found that browsing through gave an immense view about business and finances. There must surely be a better way to analyse them...

- [article 3](http://www.blonnet.com/iw/2007/07/08/stories/2007070850701300.htm)

and a report usually has the following parts...

1. Chairman's letter
2. Stock history
3. Financial Statements - Balance sheet, Income Statement
4. Products of the Company
5. Competitive Analysis
