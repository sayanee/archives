There's a pure joy of seeing a perfect "Hello World". I felt that today once again when I picked up Objective-C.

And just for fun, I decided to write out the smallest codes possible for each of the computer languages that I should be working with most for the coming year! Go ahead - <a class="vt-p" href="https://github.com/sayanee/Hello-World">get the codes of "hello world"</a> in 6 programming languages and html5 right at the github! Could I maybe extend them in any way? Have fun!
