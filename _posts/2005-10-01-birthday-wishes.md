Suddenly I find myself with so many Libran friends and all of them are turning **21**.

Happy birthday to **Geri**!! I realized that we got similarities…your regret for giving up music and traveling! Happy Birthday to **Jas**!! I got loads of similarities with this gal. Happy Birthday to HL… while she was the Brain, I was the Pinky in cedar! Happy Birthday to **Jazz**… my better half and she practically knows all my bloopers! She was from cedar, but I never knew her until in uni…haha!
