Since my Grade 5 Piano exams, I have been drilled with the various [periods of Music](http://www.classical.net/music/rep/periods.html). Each has their own distinctive characteristics, flavours, dance and instruments... it's definitely worth exploring each of these to know how music has beautifully evolved to what it is today!

1. Medieval (before 1450)
2. Renaissance (1450-1600)
3. Baroque (1600-1750)
4. Classical (1750-1820)
5. Romantic (1810-1910)
6. 20th century (1900-present)
7. Modern (1945-present)
