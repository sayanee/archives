<p align="justify">For the past few months I was looking at my friends <strong>traveling</strong> all around the world…Jas in Germany, Elaine in Scotland, Sulo and Xuan in Australia, Fen and Kit in US…while I played with Google Earth. I was thinking that it would be so nice to travel and experience all these with special other half isn’t?? I even blogged about it…"on top of Paris with that special guy!"I was just talking to my dad and he said if he had the time and money he would love to travel around Europe and he wonders if he can do it in his lifetime. And then it struck me and I never once thought about my parents when thinking about all the things I want to do in life…after all they also want to <strong>experience things</strong> they never did just like me. And as a daughter it is my responsibility that I give them their wish while enjoying myself. I have to learn to strike a fine balance. One day, when I’m working I’ll bring them around the world. And as for my mom…she has this big big big fasciantion about driving and cars… ok I shall buy a car and drive her around.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Filial Peity</strong>… To take care of our parents when they are growing old. If we are working abroad, our parents would be left all alone in our home countries. And as they grow old, they would need our presence even more to cure the loneliness and be with people they love. No amount of money or servants would replace our physcial appearance and laughter. How should I put it… I am looking around me and as years go by I see lesser and lesser grand aunties and uncles and my dad feels the lack of his elder generation…this is life and death. And many times their sons and daughter are always staying abroad. I think it’s so difficult to take care of your parents even if you want to in this situation. I am somehow not so prepared to leave them all alone at the age when they need me most. Now is fine since they are still strong in their 50s…but later???</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, even if I migrate or stay wherever while pursuing my dreams, I hope I would have the <strong>monetary means</strong> to bring my parents to stay near me… so near that they would also be able to enjoy the same things as myself. Oh they also want to stay in India…so hopefully I would have the means to shuttle them back and forth each year…hope! And i know in doing so I would also enjoy myself...back to what i had intended to do!!</p>
