<p align="justify">Everytime I take the lift to the roof top, i'll see this picture and it is definitely worth looking at it in a <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Solvay_conference_1927.jpg">higher resolution</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/solv.jpg" /></p>
<p align="justify">If you read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Solvay_conference_1927.jpg#shared-image-desc">seating position</a>, you'll know why... Schrödinger, Pauli, Heisenberg, Dirac, Broglie, Lorentz, Curie, Plank, Einstein and more. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvay_Conference">Solvay Conference</a> 1927 - out of 29 attendees, 17 are Nodel Laureates. And it was in this conference that Einstein famously said, "God does not play dice" to which Bohr replied, "Einstein stop telling God what to do!"</p>
<p align="justify">Now how many times have i tried to understand what they have come up with? And i still don't quite grasp them all...  no matter how much i might have complained mugging these laws and theories, deep inside me i'm still truly amazed by what human mind can create. Currently, i'm just reading in awe about how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed-Solomon_error_correction">Reed-Solomon codes</a> are actually used by NASA to send outer space pictures back to earth. Stunning!</p>
<p align="justify">Ok... i better get back to actually understanding how the encoding and decoding algorithms work. Another amazing stuff by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_S._Reed">Reed </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Solomon">Solomon</a>!</p>
