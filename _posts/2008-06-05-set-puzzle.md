SET Puzzle is an awesome brain teaser game. According the to NYtimes, the instructions go something like this:

A 'Set' is 3 cards in which each individual feature is either all the SAME on each card... OR all DIFFERENT on each card. That is to say, any feature in the 'Set' of three cards is either common to all three cards or is different on each card. The Features are:

- **Symbols:** Each card has _ovals, squiggles, or diamonds_ on it;
- **Color:** The symbols are _red, green, or purple_;
- **Number:** Each card has _one, two, or three symbols_ on it;
- **Shading:** The symbols are _solid, striped or open_.

And the trick is to find a SET of cards that has all elements different! Here are some links to play the game...
