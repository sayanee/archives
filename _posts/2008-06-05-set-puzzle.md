SET Puzzle is an awesome brain teaser game. According the to NYtimes, the instructions go something like this:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A 'Set' is 3 cards in which each individual feature is either all the SAME on each card... OR all DIFFERENT on each card. That is to say, any feature in the 'Set' of three cards is either common to all three cards or is different on each card.
The Features are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="bold"><strong>Symbols:</strong></span> Each card has <span class="italic"><em>ovals, squiggles, or diamonds</em></span> on it;</div></li>
	<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="bold"><strong>Color:</strong></span> The symbols are <span class="italic"><em>red, green, or purple</em></span>;</div></li>
	<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="bold"><strong>Number:</strong></span> Each card has <span class="italic"><em>one, two, or three symbols</em></span> on it;</div></li>
	<li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="bold"><strong>Shading:</strong></span> The symbols are <span class="italic"><em>solid, striped or open</em></span>.</div></li>
</ul>
And the trick is to find a SET of cards that has all elements different!
