> Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs. Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes. Being vexed, a sea nourished with lovers tears. What is it else? A madness most discreet, a choking gall and a preserving sweet. ~ William Shakespeare

Beautifully photographed by [her](http://flickr.com/photos/mylakent/104141289/). And i'm sooo addicted to [Flickr Explore](http://flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/). I have to bring out my camera more often!! Pictures can tell us so many things... I'm a visual person.
