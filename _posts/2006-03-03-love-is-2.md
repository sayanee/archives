<blockquote>
<p align="center">Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs.
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes.
Being vexed, a sea nourished with lovers tears. What is it else?
A madness most discreet, a choking gall and a preserving sweet.
<p align="center">~ William Shakespeare</p>

Beautifully photographed by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mylakent/104141289/">her</a>. And i'm sooo addicted to <a href="http://flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/">Flickr Explore</a>. I have to bring out my camera more often!! Pictures can tell us so many things... I'm a visual person.
