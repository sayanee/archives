I'm [knitting again](http://sweska.net/2007/06/23/im-knitting/) and this time i'm up for more designs. It's amazing how beautiful patterns come out with only 2 types of stitches: [knit and purl](http://knitting.about.com/od/stitchglossary/Learn_to_Knit_Knitting_Stitch_Pattern_Glossary.htm) :D And i'm getting faster in couting the number of knits and purls and dropping lesser stitches. It's all about maths in knitting... just keep counting and see your pattern grow!

> Double Moss Stitch: 1st row: K1, \*p1, k1; rep from \* to end 2nd row: p1, \*k1, p1; rep from \* to end 3rd row: as 2nd row 4th row: as 1st row rep these 4 rows
I'm itching to create a project for my own wear... one t-shirt :) ![](/img/knitting_patterns_2948urwjf.jpg)
