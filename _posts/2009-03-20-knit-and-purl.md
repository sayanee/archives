I'm <a class="vt-p" href="http://sweska.net/2007/06/23/im-knitting/">knitting again</a> and this time i'm up for more designs. It's amazing how beautiful patterns come out with only 2 types of stitches: <a class="vt-p" href="http://knitting.about.com/od/stitchglossary/Learn_to_Knit_Knitting_Stitch_Pattern_Glossary.htm">knit and purl</a> :D And i'm getting faster in couting the number of knits and purls and dropping lesser stitches. It's all about maths in knitting... just keep counting and see your pattern grow!
<blockquote><span style="color: #800000;">Double Moss Stitch:</span>
1st row: K1, *p1, k1; rep from * to end
2nd row: p1, *k1, p1; rep from * to end
3rd row: as 2nd row
4th row: as 1st row
rep these 4 rows</blockquote>
I'm itching to create a project for my own wear... one t-shirt :)
