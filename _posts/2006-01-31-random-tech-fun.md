I think it's pretty cool too Dad gave me a [PDA](http://www.mobiletechreview.com/feature/sony_TJ25.htm) which he had no use after his assignment was done. I think PDA is really so cool... reminds me of ridz! It's a mini organiser, address book, alarm clock, writing pad + mp3 player on your palm.

FINALLY!!!! I got an 'mp3' player. Lalala..hols are over! School starts tomorrow! Yippee!!!!
