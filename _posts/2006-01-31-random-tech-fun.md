Anybody tried the <a href="http://www.google.com/downloads/">Picasa</a> Collage??? I think it's pretty cool too

Dad gave me a <a href="http://www.mobiletechreview.com/feature/sony_TJ25.htm">PDA</a> which he had no use after his assignment was done. I think PDA is really so cool... reminds me of ridz! It's a mini organiser, address book, alarm clock, writing pad + mp3 player on your palm. FINALLY!!!! I got an 'mp3' player.
