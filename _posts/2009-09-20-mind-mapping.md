I have been obsessed with mapping out my chapter summaries for Accountancy... it's called Mind Maps. And i think it's a beautiful <em>ART</em>. Together with this mac app called the <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> i have been happily revising and whistling away the Sunday afternoon ;)
