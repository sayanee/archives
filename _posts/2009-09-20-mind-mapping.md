I have been obsessed with mapping out my chapter summaries for Accountancy... it's called Mind Maps. And i think it's a beautiful _ART_. Together with this mac app called the [MindNode](http://www.mindnode.com/) i have been happily revising and whistling away the Sunday afternoon ;) ![](/img/mindMap1.jpg) ![mindmap2](/img/mindmap2.jpg "mindmap2")
