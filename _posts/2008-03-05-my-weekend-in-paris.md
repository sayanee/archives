<p align="justify">Wheeee!!!! Yes i know i have been that late in updating my paris visit this weekend. It was simply awesome!</p>
<p align="justify">I took the TGV down south from the Belgium border to Gare du Nord in Paris. And i just saw and experienced this beautiful city just by walking... walked along the Seine River, attended a rally at Bastille Place, ate my sandwich inside the Palais Louvre, attended the Sunday church service at Notre Dame, walked along the long Champs-Elysees and to the Arc de Triomphe, bunked in a youth hostel with 2 other European gals, saw the gorgeous lighted up Eiffel Tower from Challiot Palace at night... it was simply breath-taking.</p>
<p align="justify">Here's a little video on the sights and seens i saw in Paris... i think i <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/download.php?Number=1125823&amp;t=k&amp;om=1">walked around 20km in 2 days</a>! Walking is of course not a problem for me. And walking is Paris is never boring.... every corner holds a story and a gorgeous monument with a little history attached to it. And Parisians are always in smiles.... you'll never get lost in Paris. There's always a metro or a bus nearby. And if you are tired... just rest in one of the benches... there are always things to see. I love Paris!!!!!</p>

<p align="justify">It's been barely a week in France for me and I have already visited Paris and discovering the north of France. I have always wanted to travel alone at least once in my life... it's this thing about quietly watching people go by, the little culture associated with everything I see... i loved my travelling in solitude. And guess what's the best part? I'm just getting started! Not at all bad for a first timer backpacking in Europe!</p>
<p align="justify">I am alone.... but never lonely. Where will this weekend's journey bring me to?</p>
