It's merely been 2 week here in France, and after taking a grotesque amount ofÂ 840 photos and 114 video clips, i'm down to a measly 8 for a showcase. It's hard to have that kinda _ooohhh_ _la la_ photography... i must surely be taking a DSLR on my next travel tales to maybe improve my rate of photo production.

Till then... presenting you that part of France I have seen so far...
