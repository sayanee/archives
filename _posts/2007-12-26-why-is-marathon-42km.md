<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_(sports)">Marathon </a>is exactly <strong>42.195km</strong>. Why? Why isn't it 40km or 30km or 50km? and where did this word <em>marathon</em> came from?
<p align="justify">The name marathon comes from the legend of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheidippides">Pheidippides</a>, a Greek soldier, who was sent from the town of Marathon to Athens (distance is roughly 40km) to announce that the Persians had been defeated in the Battle of Marathon.</p>
<p align="justify">In the modern Olympics, at first the exact distance of 42.195km was not fixed until 1908.</p>
