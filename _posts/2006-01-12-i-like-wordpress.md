[Wordpress!!! ](http://wordpress.com/) You don't need so many 3rd party stuff becasue it already has **in-built features** like:

- recent comments
- calendar of entries
- password protected entries... a much safer encryption!!!
- i think you can install wordpress and host the blog in your own server...right uzyn??
- page loads / visitors
- search engine within your blog
- entries that can be categorised

Ok i know for _some_ of you this is ...bleah... hehe but i'm only discovering. Ok i'm slow!

But how do I **customise** the layout like blogspot?? I can't seem to get hold of the Template html codes. Because of this i cannot add my own pictures in the side bar or header :( How do you also increase the size of the contents... i like the entries to fill the whole page! I also want to install google analytics in my template page when it's out! How do i do all these...

I discovered Wordpress last year, but how come on earth i didn't bother to open an account to try it until NOW?? Especailly since I was playing with other blogging spheres like Livejournal, Xanga, ebloggy...blah blah...

But until the next hols this will be my blog. Blogspot has taught me a lot because of it's tremendous ability to add 3rd party stuff + template pages which can be customised! I learnt some html stuff with dreamweaver to help me, I learnt how to blog with flash and pictures. I have learnt so much that even Ash says that i'm becoming a tech-savvy gal *ahem* Next hols i'll experiment a lot with wordpress!! I have a feeling that wordpress is written in PHP.

Any more fun stuff in Wordpress??? Tech gurus please have your say...
