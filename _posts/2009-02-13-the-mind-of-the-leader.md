<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">…effective leaders can end up making poor decisions because able and well-meaning followers are untied and persuasive about a course of action… Charismatic leaders, who are most susceptible to this problem, need to make an effort to unearth disagreement and to find followers who are not afraid to pose hard questions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; ">The example of Polaroid and Land suggests how leaders think about goals. They are active instead of reactive, shaping ideas instead of responding to them. Leaders adopt a personal and active attitude towards goal. The influence a leader exerts in altering moods, evoking images and expectations, and in establishing specific desires and objectives determines the direction a business takes.</p>
