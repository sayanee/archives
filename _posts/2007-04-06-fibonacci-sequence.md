title: Fibonacci Sequence
---

I knew what is [Fibonacci Sequence](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=Fibonacci+sequence&meta=)... 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,... basically the new term = addition of the last 2 old terms. But i didn't know it could be represented as a linear generator. This was what my prof for [Spread Spectrum ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum)drew on the board...

I have to come back and visit this Fibonacci stuff again... very interesting!
