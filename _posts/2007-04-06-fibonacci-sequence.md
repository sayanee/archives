I knew what is <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Fibonacci+sequence&amp;meta=">Fibonacci Sequence</a>...

1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,... basically the new term = addition of the last 2 old terms.

But i didn't know it could be represented as a linear generator. This was what my prof for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum">Spread Spectrum </a>drew on the board...
