Just read this in 'The Success Principles' by Jack Canfield. He mentioned Azim Jamal talking about the hours of power which includes:

- 20 minutes of visualisation of our dreams/meditation/self-time/prayer
- 20 minutes of exercise
- 20 minutes of reading inspirational / informational books

how true!! It's definitely an hour of power
