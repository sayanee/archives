Just read this in 'The Success Principles' by Jack Canfield. He mentioned Azim Jamal talking about the hours of power which includes:
<ul>
	<li>20 minutes of visualisation of our dreams/meditation/self-time/prayer</li>
	<li>20 minutes of exercise</li>
	<li>20 minutes of reading inspirational / informational books</li>
</ul>
how true!! It's definitely an hour of power
