As part of the <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/">European Southern Observatory</a>, Chille has a bunch of <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/astronomy/teles-instr/paranal.html">spectacular telescopes</a> that point to the skies. This place goes into my list of places to visit.

One more thing... i love their podcast. Do <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ESOcastSD">subscribe</a> to that in the iTunes!
