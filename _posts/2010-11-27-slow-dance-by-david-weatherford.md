title: Slow Dance by David Weatherford
---
Have you ever watched kids on a merry-go-round? <br>
Or listened to the rain slapping on the ground?<br>
Ever followed a butterfly’s erratic flight?<br>
Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?<br>
You’d better slow down.<br>
Don’t dance so fast.<br>
Time is short,<br>
The music won’t last.

Do you run through each day on the fly? <br>
When you ask "How are you?" <br>
Do you hear the reply? <br>
When the day is done do you lie in your bed <br>
With the next hundred chores running <br>
through your head? <br>
You’d better slow down. <br>
Don’t dance so fast. <br>
Time is short. <br>
The music won’t last.

Ever told your child, "We’ll do it tomorrow?" <br>
And in your haste, not see his sorrow? <br>
Ever lost touch, let a good friendship die <br>
Cause you never had time to call and say "Hi?" <br>
You’d better slow down. <br>
Don’t dance so fast. <br>
Time is short. <br>
The music won’t last. <br>

When you run so fast to get somewhere <br>
You miss half the fun of getting there. <br>
When you worry and hurry through your day, <br>
It is like an unopened gift… <br>
Thrown away. <br>

Life is not a race. <br>
Do take it slower <br>
Hear the music <br>
Before your song is over.
