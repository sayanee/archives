Everyday i do realise how lucky i am and whenever it comes to the crunch of stress or dead-end, i do recall them in those moments. Now here's something fun i found... I downloaded the [Gratitude Journal](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=299604556&mt=8) iPhone app. Maybe every now and then, i can type in those little moments of the day that still points to me about how lucky i am. It's a mash up of something _boliao_ and yet something very _deep_. What are you grateful for today?
