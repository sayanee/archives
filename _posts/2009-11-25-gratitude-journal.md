Everyday i do realise how lucky i am and whenever it comes to the crunch of stress or dead-end, i do recall them in those moments.

Now here's something fun i found... I downloaded the <a class="vt-p" href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=299604556&amp;mt=8">Gratitude Journal</a> iPhone app. Maybe every now and then, i can type in those little moments of the day that still points to me about how lucky i am. It's a mash up of something <em>boliao</em> and yet something very <em>deep</em>.

What are you grateful for today?
