there are only 6 major constants according to [Martin Rees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Martin_Rees):

1. **?, Nu**: the ratio of the coupling constants for the electroweak force and gravitation (circa 1043). The former is simply the fine structure constant, while the latter is the gravitational coupling constant;
2. **?, Epsilon**: related to the strong force;
3. **?, Omega**: the number of electrons and protons in the observable universe (circa 1080);
4. **?, Lambda**: the cosmological constant;
5. **Q**: a ratio of fundamental energies;
6. **?, Delta**: the number of spatial dimensions.
