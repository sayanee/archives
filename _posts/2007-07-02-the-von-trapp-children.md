title: The Von Trapp family children

[The Sound of Music ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/)is undoubtedly one of my fav Musical, especially the version in the 1965Â movie. This picture shows when the 7 kids were acting in the movie.

And this has to be a really nostalgic photo taken when all the 7 actors [came together in Salzburg](http://www.sound-of-music.com/reunion/).
