title: my daily companions
---

They are fast becoming my daily companions... wherever i go they are always with me - the heavy and bulky boots and my helmet!! And along with them comes the stairscase climbing up and down of at least 100 steps and walking at least 0.5km almost 3km daily. Huh! Who needs to go gym ;)

But more than these 'workouts' and 'gears', it's the people i'm meeting that's teaching me more. It's been an emmensely humbling experience. Everytime i see someone we call a _worker_, i'll remember that he's much more stronger i am! I'm surely learning... from unexpected things here and there.

and yeah... it's all thanks to my helmet and my boots!
