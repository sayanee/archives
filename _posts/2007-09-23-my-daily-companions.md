<p align="justify">They are fast becoming my daily companions... wherever i go they are always with me - the heavy and bulky boots and my helmet!! And along with them comes the stairscase climbing up and down of at least 100 steps and walking <strike>at least 0.5km</strike> almost 3km daily. Huh! Who needs to go gym ;)</p>
<p align="justify">But more than these 'workouts' and 'gears', it's the people i'm meeting that's teaching me more. It's been an emmensely humbling experience. Everytime i see someone we call a <em>worker</em>, i'll remember that he's much more stronger i am! I'm surely learning... from unexpected things here and there.</p>
<p align="justify">and yeah... it's all thanks to my helmet and my boots!</p>
