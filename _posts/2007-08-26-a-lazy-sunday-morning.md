<p align="justify">Nothing beats a lazy sunday morning chit-chat amidst the bees and ants under the tree - a picnic!! It's like a break amidst the fast paced life. Gals... i promise i'll bring <em>masala</em>Â  snacks the next time armed with more nonsense :P</p>
<p align="justify">i'm still lucky enough not get stuck in the monotony of life... that'll be such a bore! My days are occupied as ever and little spaces such as these fills me up just tightly. But I need them nonetheless... to look really far ahead.</p>
<p align="justify">wwhhooopppsss.... another week!</p>
