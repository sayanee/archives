All gone.... i'm not cheery anymore....all lost... i lost my hard disk. It's not in my room, i don't remember it in my journey to school, and it's NOT lost in school in any way. My contact was written on the cover and IF somebody had found it, he would have called me. Devastated... what should i do? Life goes on. Ok back to searching my room again.
