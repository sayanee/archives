When taking this shot, i never quite realised the contrast between the old and new mode of transportation - the boat on the sand and the modern SIA plane, until it was [mentioned by someone](http://flickr.com/photos/sweska/201880211/#comment72157594217393554). Hmmm... i think i like taking pics with contrasting subjects. It shows that diversity exists!
