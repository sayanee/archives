<p align="left">After incessant tantrum throwing yesterday, dad couldn't take it anymore and we went out immediately and look what we got...</p>
<p align="center"><img width="239" src="/img/ix65.jpg" height="380" style="width: 239px; height: 380px" /></p>
<p align="justify">It's a <a href="http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/ixus65/index-e.html">Canon Digital IXUS65</a>!!! OOooohhh i hope it's a much better point and shoot with 6 mega pixel and 3X zoom. I was going through other <a href="http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/ixus65/spe-e.html">technical specifications</a>, but well other than zoom and resolution, i don't understand the rest :P</p>
<p align="justify">So in all i bought a <a href="http://www.rivacase.ru/pages/gocart/riva-case-7023-pu30.php">sleek sexy case</a> that fits in my palm, a mini tripod, 1GB storage and most importantly i emptied my bank account. Talk about impulse buying! Well, with 53 bucks left Sweska is really poor now. But i am immensely happy :D Yyyiiiiiipppeeeeee!!!!!</p>
