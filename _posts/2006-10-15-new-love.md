After incessant tantrum throwing yesterday, dad couldn't take it anymore and we went out immediately and look what we got...

It's a [Canon Digital IXUS65](http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/ixus65/index-e.html)!!! OOooohhh i hope it's a much better point and shoot with 6 mega pixel and 3X zoom. I was going through other [technical specifications](http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/ixus65/spe-e.html), but well other than zoom and resolution, i don't understand the rest :P

So in all i bought a [sleek sexy case](http://www.rivacase.ru/pages/gocart/riva-case-7023-pu30.php) that fits in my palm, a mini tripod, 1GB storage and most importantly i emptied my bank account. Talk about impulse buying! Well, with 53 bucks left Sweska is really poor now. But i am immensely happy :D Yyyiiiiiipppeeeeee!!!!!
