another short story from the Monk who sold his Ferrari
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">One night a father was relaxing with his newspaper after a long day at office. His son, who wanted to play, kept on pestering him. Finally fed up, the father ripped out a picture of the globe that was in the paper and tore it into a 100 tiny pieces. “Here go on son and try to put this back,” he said hoping that this would keep the little boy busy long enough to finish his paper. To his amazement, his son returned after only 1 minute with the globe perfectly back together. When the startled father asked how he achieved this feat, the son smiled gently and replied, “Dad, on the other side of the globe, there was a picture of a person, an once I got the person together, the world was okay!”</p>
