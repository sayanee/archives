This is where i'll be putting up for the next 3 months... i love it!! Even if it's so cold outside, it's really warm in here... the bed is really comfortable after a long day's work. And there's this little table were i kinda sqeeze in both laptops and the small rice cooker (i'm starting to figure out how to cook finally!!). Bath tub with warm water is always there too. I never knew i could be this comfortable in such cold.

Guess i'm starting to like winter as well!! It can still be colourful... no?
