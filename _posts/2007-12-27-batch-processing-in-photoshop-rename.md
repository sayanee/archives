so you have a folder of photos to be distributed and you want to sort of standardise the names... batch processing is a wonderful quick and easy way to do so. Here's how i learnt to do it...

1. Open Photoshop
2. **Ctrl+Shift+O** to open Adobe Bridge
3. Browse to the folder of the photos you want to rename
4. Select all by **Ctrl + A**
5. Right Click -> Batch Rename ![](/img/file_rename_photoshop1.jpg)
6. put in the way you want to name each of the photos in series

![](/img/file_rename_photoshop2.jpg)

Voila it's done!
