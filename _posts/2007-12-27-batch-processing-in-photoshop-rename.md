so you have a folder of photos to be distributed and you want to sort of standardise the names... batch processing is a wonderful quick and easy way to do so. Here's how i learnt to do it...
<ol>
	<li>Open Photoshop</li>
	<li><strong>Ctrl+Shift+O</strong> to open Adobe Bridge</li>
	<li>Browse to the folder of the photos you want to rename</li>
	<li>Select all by <strong>Ctrl + A</strong></li>
	<li>Right Click -&gt; Batch Rename<img src="/img/file_rename_photoshop1.jpg" /></li>
	<li>put in the way you want to name each of the photos in series</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/file_rename_photoshop2.jpg" /></p>
<p align="center">Voila it's done!</p>
