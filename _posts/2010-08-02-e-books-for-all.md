I'm very excited about this project - <a href="http://worldreader.org">World Reader</a>. Taken from their <a href="http://worldreader.org/what-we-do.php">about page</a>:
<blockquote>Worldreader.org is developing the systems and the partnerships to get <strong>e-readers</strong>....into the hands and minds of people in the developing world...</blockquote>
Now many kids in Africa and beyond will get to view the already existing libraries of free books, including that of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">project gutenberg</a> :)
