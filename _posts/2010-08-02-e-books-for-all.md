I'm very excited about this project - [World Reader](http://worldreader.org). Taken from their [about page](http://worldreader.org/what-we-do.php):

> Worldreader.org is developing the systems and the partnerships to get **e-readers**....into the hands and minds of people in the developing world...
Now many kids in Africa and beyond will get to view the already existing libraries of free books, including that of [project gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page) :) ![](/img/world-reader-org.jpg "world-reader-org")
