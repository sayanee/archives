<p align="justify">I’m falling in love with <strong>MacRitchie</strong>. This time it wasn’t a hike around the edges of the water…it was kayaking right in the waters with the lush greenery surrounding you. The water is so clean, the greenery is so serene and you are directly under the sky amidst the sun, the rain and the clouds. I finally completed my <strong>One-star kayaking course </strong>after 2 days of training together with a strong reminder about nature’s powerful and beautiful existence even in the midst of man’s creation.</p>

<p align="justify">Anyway I also learnt about some theory…what is the difference between a <strong>Kayak</strong> and a <strong>Canoe</strong>?? Kayaks are closed in boats with double-ended paddles, while Canoes are open boats with single paddles. I learnt different strokes to maneuver my kayak…Sweep stroke, Stern Rader, back stroke, forward stroke and also how to capsize and rescue! It was definitely an eye-opener and a worthy 2 days spent being sun burnt and returning home with aching arms. And it is especially memorable and exciting when you have a wonderful company to do it with you…<strong><font color="#000099">THANK YOU PEIXUAN!!</font> </strong></p>
