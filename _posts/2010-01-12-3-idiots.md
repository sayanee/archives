title: 3 idiots
---

It's a movie!!! And I love it :P [Amir Khan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aamir_Khan) never fails to make movie masterpieces and this is surely one of my fav!

Any student or a young adult will be able to relate to this movie. It tells us once again how we should be chasing our strengths and passions and not living a life getting all the grades and then end up getting a high paid, stable job, not knowing what we want! 3 idiots is a very humorous movie and coupled with my fav, [Kareena Kapoor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareena_Kapoor) and Bollywood style, it did make my weekend a blast :P

I admit, I used to think that grades would give me money and societal prestige. Yes, it might give us that most of the time... but it does not guarantee that I would be _living_ my life and having _fun_... you know that?

I wasn't an _idiot_ before. And now I wanna be an _idiot_.
