[IP rating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code) (or Ingress Protection Rating) is an itneresting way to find out the degrees of protection for an object.  It consists of 2 digits... First digit:  

| Level | Object size protected against | Effective against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | — | No protection against contact and ingress of objects |
| **1** | >50 mm | Any large surface of the body, such as the back of a hand, but no protection against deliberate contact with a body part |
| **2** | >12.5 mm | Fingers or similar objects |
| **3** | >2.5 mm | Tools, thick wires, etc. |
| **4** | >1 mm | Most wires, screws, etc. |
| **5** | dust protected | Ingress of dust is not entirely prevented, but it must not enter in sufficient quantity to interfere with the satisfactory operation of the equipment; complete protection against contact |
| **6** | dust tight | No ingress of dust; complete protection against contact |

  Second Digit:

| Level | Protected against | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | not protected | — |
| **1** | dripping water | Dripping water (vertically falling drops) shall have no harmful effect. |
| **2** | dripping water when tilted up to 15° | Vertically dripping water shall have no harmful effect when the enclosure is tilted at an angle up to 15° from its normal position. |
| **3** | spraying water | Water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60° from the vertical shall have no harmful effect. |
| **4** | splashing water | Water splashing against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effect. |
| **5** | water jets | Water projected by a nozzle against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects. |
| **6** | powerful water jets | Water projected in powerful jets against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects. |
| **7** | immersion up to 1 m | Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion). |
| **8** | immersion beyond 1 m | The equipment is suitable for continuous immersion in water under conditions which shall be specified by the manufacturer. NOTE: Normally, this will mean that the equipment is hermetically sealed. However, with certain types of equipment, it can mean that water can enter but only in such a manner that produces no harmful effects. |
