<strong>ISO</strong> (International Organisation for Standards) is also the <strong>Film speed</strong> in photography. Film speed is the measure of photography film's sensitivity to light. Film with lower sensitivity (lower ISO) requires a longer exposure and is thus called a <strong>slow film</strong>, filmÂ with higher sensitivity (higher ISO) can shoot the same scene with a shorter exposure and is called a <strong>fast film</strong>.
