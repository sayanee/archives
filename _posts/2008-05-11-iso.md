**ISO** (International Organisation for Standards) is also the **Film speed** in photography.

Film speed is the measure of photography film's sensitivity to light. Film with lower sensitivity (lower ISO) requires a longer exposure and is thus called a **slow film**, filmÂ with higher sensitivity (higher ISO) can shoot the same scene with a shorter exposure and is called a **fast film**.
