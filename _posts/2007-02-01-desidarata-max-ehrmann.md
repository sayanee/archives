There are many written down lists of leading a way of life. I like Desidarata because it is practical, and yet it tells you to go silently and humbly. Read more about [Desidarata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderata) and here's the full excerpt...

> Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.

> As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

> Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.

> Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit.

> If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

> Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.

> Keep interested in your career, however humble,Â  it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

> Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery.

> But let this not blind you to what virtue there is, Many persons strive for high ideals and everywhere life is full of heroism.

> Be yourself.

> Especially do not feign affection.

> Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.

> Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

> Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.

> But do not distress yourself with imaginings.

> Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

> Beyond a wholesome discipline be gentle to yourself.

> You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars and you have a right to be here.

> And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

> Therefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.

> And whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace with your soul.

> With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.

> Be cheerful.

> Strive to be happy.
