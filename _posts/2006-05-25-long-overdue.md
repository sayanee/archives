Nothing beats pigging out with good ol' friends... We went out... and since i'm too lazy to blog what happend I shall just quote from KT :P ![](/img/ktjc.jpg)

_...Then we played scrabble and monopoly._

_I was quite happy to point out that due to my good luck at the right time, I practically MONOPOLISED the entire monopoly session.I actually started out as the underdog but with a sudden turn I exploded and started alot of shrewd acquisitions and in the end I was the winner of the game._

_The most funny thing was when people went to jail. Seeing them go to jail give you a high, as long as it is not you who went to jail. And even better. _

_During one round, GH just got out of jail. He landed on 'chance', which sent him back to jail immediately after he got out. We laughed and laughed until Basu got hiccups. Then barely three rounds later, GH went back to jail again because of 'community chest' He got the highest record of going to jail for the night._

So that was KT's biased version... notice how he didn't even mention how badly he did in **scrabble**... tsk tsk tsk. And anyway when i had hiccups nobody could cure it...despite having a med student + 2 life students... instead all laugh laugh and make me laugh and more hiccups. Crazy friends i have :) Still can't live without them...what to do??
