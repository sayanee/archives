<p align="left">Nothing beats pigging out with good ol' friends... We went out... and since i'm too lazy to blog what happend I shall just quote from KT :P<img src="/img/ktjc.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></p>
<p align="justify"><em>...Then we played scrabble and monopoly.</em></p>
<p align="justify"><em>I was quite happy to point out that due to my good luck at the right time, I practically MONOPOLISED the entire monopoly session.I actually started out as the underdog but with a sudden turn I exploded and started alot of shrewd acquisitions and in the end I was the winner of the game.</em></p>
<p align="justify"><em>The most funny thing was when people went to jail. Seeing them go to jail <span style="color: #003333;">give you a high</span>, as long as it is not you who went to jail. And even better. </em></p>
<p align="justify"><em>During one round, GH just got out of jail. He landed on 'chance', which sent him back to jail immediately after he got out. We laughed and laughed until <span style="color: #333333;">Basu got hiccups</span>. Then barely three rounds later, <span style="color: #003333;">GH went back to jail again </span>because of 'community chest' He got the highest record of going to jail for the night.</em></p>
<p align="left">So that was <span style="color: #990000;">KT's biased version</span>... notice how he didn't even mention how badly he did in <strong><span style="color: #993333;">scrabble</span></strong>... tsk tsk tsk. And anyway when i had hiccups nobody could cure it...despite having a med student + 2 life students... instead all laugh laugh and make me laugh and more hiccups. Crazy friends i have :) Still can't live without them...what to do??</p>
<p align="justify">thanks KT for the wonderful evening! Brings out a lot of memories of those havoc days... and i found this pic... haha really funny! Wonder why ogh, ridz and anand were pretending to be elephants behind me... and that miss loo didn't even tell me! oh well!!</p>
