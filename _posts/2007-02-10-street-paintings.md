Have u seen paintings like these on the street? They are drawn in the perspective such that the street walker will have an illusion of a real hole, image on the pavement...

These guys are really cool... they are [Julian Beever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Beever) and [Kurt Wenner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Wenner)
