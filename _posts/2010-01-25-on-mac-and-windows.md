I have finally installed Windows on my MacBook as well and I'm happy that I can continue both operating systems very effectively :) With the [Boot Camp](http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/) and a [little help from school](http://www.smu.edu.sg/CIT/helpdesk/), I can finally use many spreadsheet functions and financial database syncing available only for Windows on the very same machine! I love how it all all integrate smoothly and yet i can have the choice of both! We should not be restricted to using just one operating system.

But of course, now i have to do a bit of fire-fighting with both the Mac and PC camp people. And I won't stop here actually. I can't wait to get my hands on Ubuntu soon :D
