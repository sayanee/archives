I have finally installed Windows on my MacBook as well and I'm happy that I can continue both operating systems very effectively :) With the <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a> and a <a href="http://www.smu.edu.sg/CIT/helpdesk/">little help from school</a>, I can finally use many spreadsheet functions and financial database syncing available only for Windows on the very same machine!

I love how it all all integrate smoothly and yet i can have the choice of both! We should not be restricted to using just one operating system.

But of course, now i have to do a bit of fire-fighting with both the Mac  and PC camp people. And I won't stop here actually. I can't wait to get my hands on Ubuntu soon :D
