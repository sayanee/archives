So what is the difference between these sentences?
<ul>
	<li>I love to listen to people singing christman carols - participle
I love to listen to people who sing christmas carols - relative pronoun</li>
	<li>I saw a little boy being bitten by the dog - participle
I saw a little boy who was bitten by the dog - relative pronoun</li>
</ul>
<div>In the <strong>participle</strong> case, the 2 functions are happening at the same time</div>
<div>In the <strong>relative pronoun</strong> case, the reader does not know when the action (stated after who) occurs</div>
