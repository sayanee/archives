title: In leader or an Out leader
---

From the [Harvard Business article](http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/corkindale/2009/11/are_you_an_in_or_an_out_leader.html):

**In Leaders:**

- Focus on results and deliverable
- Coach and support their people
- Build team spirit
- Offer expert knowledge or share experience
- Monitor performance/quality control
- Are present and available
- Surface and deal with conflict

**Out Leaders:**

- Get involved in cross-organisational initiatives
- Build networks
- Delegate extensively
- Manage their profiles and visibility
- Engage with peers inside and outside their companies
- Look after their careers
- Engage in organisational politics
- Join committees
- Attend or speak at industry conferences

So how much time will you spend in these 2 categories?
