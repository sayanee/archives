From the <a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/corkindale/2009/11/are_you_an_in_or_an_out_leader.html">Harvard Business article</a>:
<blockquote><strong>In Leaders:</strong>

* Focus on results and deliverable

* Coach and support their people

* Build team spirit

* Offer expert knowledge or share experience

* Monitor performance/quality control

* Are present and available

* Surface and deal with conflict

<strong>Out Leaders:</strong>

* Get involved in cross-organisational initiatives

* Build networks

* Delegate extensively

* Manage their profiles and visibility

* Engage with peers inside and outside their companies

* Look after their careers

* Engage in organisational politics

* Join committees

* Attend or speak at industry conferences</blockquote>
So how much time will you spend in these 2 categories?
