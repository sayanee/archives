Can you see a face written with crotchets and quavers abd hemi-demi-semi-quavers?? A guy with curly hair and a moutache! Found from <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.neatorama.com/2007/03/11/atushi-ojisama-crazy-sheet-music/#comments">this article</a>... wow!! both visual art and music in one piece... wondering how it'll sound :P
