a short story… I read from Brian Tracy… more on his book another day and for now it’s the short story…

>  

> Once upon a time, long time ago, in a far away, there lived an old man in a house on top of a hill. He had declared his entire life to study and meditation. He was known far and wide for his intelligence, sensitivity and wisdom. Politicians, businesspeople, and dignitarities came to visit him and ask him questions. His answers were always correct. He seemed to have a special faculty that enabled him to cut to the essence of any problem or issue. When his answers and solutions were implemented, the result was always excellent. His fame soon spread throughout the land. In the village below the hill was a group of boys who played together. Sometimes they climbed the hill to visit the old man and ask him questions, for which he always seemed have the correct answer. Over time, it became a little game, with the bouys continually trying to think of a question that the old man could not answer. Buy they were never successful. One day, the ring leader of the group, a boy named Aram, called the others around him and said, “I have finally found a way to stump the old man. Here in my had, I have a bird. We will go and ask  the old man if the bird is alive or dead. If he says that is it is dead, I will release it and it will fly away. If he says it is alive, I will crush it, and the bird will be dead. Either way, he will at last  have been proven wrong.” Excited about the prospect of finally catching the old an with a wrong answer, they hurried up the hill. The old man watched them coming and noticed the eager looks on their faces. Then Aram stepped forward and asked, “Old man, I have a bird in my hand. Is it alive or is it dead?”

Got any meaning out of it? a metaphor for life?
