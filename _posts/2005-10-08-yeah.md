Yeah!! I am creating better and better flash animations in shorter time!! I'm so proud of my creation...aka my baby!! I think i have watched it for 50 times and i'm STILL not bored and it's only one minute!!

Anyway a big learning point: Flash created the one minute animation for 5MB and when i exported it to a \*.avi movie it was 2GB with bad bad image and sound quality....WOW!!...I rather stick to vector graphics of Flash.......I LOVE FLASH!!!!

But then i realised i really forgot Action Script...what command to use to open a doc with a button??...i tried goToURL with a valid and complete path C:\........doesn't work!!
