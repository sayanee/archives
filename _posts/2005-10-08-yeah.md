I'm so proud of my creation...aka my baby!! I think i have watched it for <font color="#cc0000">50 times </font>and i'm STILL not bored and it's only <font color="#996633">one minute</font>!!</p>
<p align="justify">Anyway a big learning point: Flash created the one minute animation for 5MB and when i exported it to a *.avi movie it was 2GB with bad bad image and sound quality....WOW!!...I rather stick to vector graphics of Flash.......<font color="#cc0000">I LOVE FLASH!!!!</font></p>
