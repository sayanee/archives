This post is about my journey in the Art of Public Speaking... and how i once forgot to keep learning.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-625" title="recitation-childhood" src="/img/recitation-childhood.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267" align="left" />When I was 4 years old, my mom made me first enter a poetry reading competition. Since then, every year during <a class="vt-p" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja">Durga Puja</a> festivals, she would drill me to speak out the <a class="vt-p" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore">Tagore</a> or <a class="vt-p" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukumar_Ray">Sukumar Ray</a>'s <a class="vt-p" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abol_Tabol">Abol Tabol</a> Bengali poetry poems and I used to recite it out during the competitions. She would train me in throwing out my voice, in expressions, pronunciations and even pauses. I would be very nervous speaking in the public, but every time I always won these competitions. That was my childhood.

During my adolescence, I was again very frequently asked to enter oratorical contests in primary and secondary schools. I can remember winning contests within my schools. But something happened when i reached the university... either because of laziness or my self-ego, I decided not to do anything. I was quiet, passive and the skill was becoming forgotten... almost forgotten until i entered my post-grad studies and I had to deliver 3 speeches within a span of 1 week. I spoke for the Speaking skills workshop, the <a class="vt-p" href="/as/">Business case workshop</a> and also for the <a class="vt-p" href="/colors-of-the-sky/">Creative Crew meeting</a>. The experience was great and I had loads of encouragements.

And then it finally hit me that no matter what skill you once had, there's nothing more inspiring and interesting than to keep up with it. I need to keep learning, unlearning and re-learning and meeting people who inspire me in that skill.

So, a couple of days back, I finally decided to go for my first <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters</a> meeting in school. It was simply euphoric. I loved the people there, I loved the speeches and evaluations given. And I decided to re-learn everything about public speaking and start with the <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.toastmasters.org/MainMenuCategories/WhatisToastmasters/CommunicationandLeadershipTraining.aspx">Competent Communicator project</a>. I truly hope, i would be able to deliver my first speech for Project 1: Ice Breaker by this year and when that happens, you will know :) And if you also want to learn/re-learn public speaking, do <a class="vt-p" href="http://reports.toastmasters.org/findaclub/">find a club near near you</a> and start having fun!

I would want to end with 2 compelling thought / questions in my mind right now:
<blockquote>When was the last time you did something for the first time?

When was the last time you unlearned something to re-learn it?</blockquote>
I just did :) Thank you mom.
