<p align="justify"><strong>Book Title:</strong> The Speed Reading Book
<strong>Author:</strong> Tony Buzan
<strong>Year written/published:</strong> 1971
<strong>My Comment:</strong> was really frustrated... i wanted to read loads of books and it was taking me soooo much time!! My reading speed at the start of this book was <font color="#008080"><strong>248 wpm</strong></font>. And <a href="http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/brainchat_adam_pre.html">Sean Adam </a>has a world record of <font color="#008080"><strong>3850 wpm</strong></font>!!!!!!! And president Kennedy famously had a reading speed of 1000 wpm :P Speed reading doesn't only train people to read fast but also to comprehend and understand the passage better. A lot os emphasis was also placed in the vocabulary by learning the main prefix, suffix and roots of many words. This is truly a great book.... hope it'll be the book which will make me read many other great books!

<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading">History of Speed reading</a>:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Pilots were unable to distinguish planes seen at a distant. ... ... ... To their surprise they found that with training, the average person was able to distinguish almost specklike representations of different planes when the images had been flashed on the screen for only one five hundredth of a second.</p>

using peripheral vision for speed reading:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">... ... while your clear focus is reading the one, thw and three lines on which you are concentrating, your 'brain reader' is using its peripheral vision to review that you have already read and preview the text to come. ... ... .An added advantage of this 'soft-focus' appraoch is that your eyes have to do far less tight muscular fixating. They therefore become far less tired and you feel able to go on reading for longer periods of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">On using a thin long object as a guide to reading...</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">... ... common knowledge that speed readers read 'down the middle of the page' ... .... This is beacuse the eyes can see up to 5/6 words at a time so they can easily fixate after the beginning and before the end of line, thus taking the information to the side. The guide therefore minimises the amount of work the eyes have to do, keeps the brain focused, and gives you constant and gives you contant accelerations in reading speed while maintaining high comprehension.Â </p>
