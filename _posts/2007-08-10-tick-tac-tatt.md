I have just learnt [tatting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatting)... the art of making laces. This is gonna be a bookmark! I can't believe that suddenly i'm unleashing all these craving for needle and string crafts... ohh la la :P I can't simply wait to go on into creating more patterns and designs, but first back to the basics!
