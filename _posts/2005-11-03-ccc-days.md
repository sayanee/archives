some words never made any sense until...

>  

> Life in Mono - Mono

> The stranger sang a theme From someone else’s dream The leaves began to fall And no one spoke at all But I can’t seem to recall When you came along

> Ingenue Ingenue I just don’t know what to do

> The tree-lined avenue Begins to fade from view Drowning past regrets In tea and cigarettes But I can’t seem to forget When you came along

> Ingenue Ingenue I just don’t know what to do
