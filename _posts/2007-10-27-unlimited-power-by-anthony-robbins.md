On success...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Bunker Hunt, the Texas oil billionaire was asked once if he had any one piece of advice he could give people on how to succeed. He said that success is simple. First, you decide what you want specifically; and second, you decide you're willing to pay the price to make it happen - and then pay the price.</p>
</blockquote>
beliefs...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In fact, there's no more powerful directing force in human behaviour than belief. The people, who have changed history - whether Jesus, Mohamed, Copernicus, Columbus, Edison or Einstein - have been the people who have changed our beliefs. If we want to model excellence, we need to learn to model the beliefs of those who achieve excellence.</p>
</blockquote>
breathing patterns...
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Let me share with you the most effective way to breathe in order to cleanse your system. You should c=breathe in this ratio: inhale one count, hold 4 counts, exhale 2 counts... ... ... Why exhale for twice as long as you inhale? That's when you eliminate toxins via your lymphatic system. Why hold 4 times as long? That's how you can fully oxygenate the blood and activate your lymphatic system. When you breathe, you should start from deep in your abdomen, like a vacuum cleaner that's getting rid of all toxins in the blood system.</p>

<p align="justify">how behaviours spread... 100th monkey syndrome</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Now this is not unique. There are numerous cases where individuals with no way of coming in contact with one another act in remarkable unison. One physicist will get an idea, and simultaneously 3 physicist elsewhere will get the same idea. How does this happen? No one knows precisely, but many prominent scientists, biologist believe that there is a collective conscience we can all pull from - and that when we align ourselves through belief, through focus, through optimal physiology, we find a way to dip into this collective consciousness.
A key part of this process is knowing what you want The unconscious mind is constantly processing information in such a way as to move us in particular directions. Even at the unconscious level, the mind is distorting, deleting, and generalising. So before the mind can work efficiently, we must develop our perception of the outcomes we expect to reach. When the mind has a defined target, it can focus and direct and refocus and redirect until it reaches its intended goal.</blockquote>
<p align="justify">opposites attract?</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Want to know the worst cliche over coined? "Opposites attract". Like most things that are false, it has element of difference add a certain excitement to things. But overall, who is attractive to you? Whom do you want to spend time with? Are you looking for someone who disagrees with on everything, has different interests... ...  Of course not! You want to be with people who are like you and yet unique.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">stories...</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">There's a famous story told about Tom Watson, the founder of IBM. One of his subordinates had made a horrendous mistake that has cost the company and said, "I suppose you want my resignation.: Watson looked at him and said, "Are you kidding? we just spent 10 million dolalrs educating you!"</p>
