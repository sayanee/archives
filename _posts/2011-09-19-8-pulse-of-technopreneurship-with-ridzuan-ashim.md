title: ! '#8 Pulse of Technopreneurship with Ridzuan Ashim'
---
This time I met up with my decade old high school friend - Ridzuan Ashim.

Although it has been more than 10 years, I'm always bumping into Ridz because both of our affinity towards technology and the vibrant hacker community in Singapore. I decided to catch a chat with him this time at the [Hackerspace Singapore](http://hackerspace.sg/). As always Ridz never fails to give insights into various lessons that he has picked up along the way through his journey of building technology businesses.

Let's hear from him about his pulses of yesterday, today and tomorrow! Good luck Ridz for [Streetegy](http://streetegy.com/), his current startup that he plans to launch in the coming months. Let's keep in touch ;-)
