![](/img/night2.jpg) 7th April started right from 12am. We were still in school…a **RECORD**!!!! We stayed in school until 130am…Returned home at 2am with a cab fare of **24 bucks**!!! Was still editting the videos until I finally slept at 330am and then overslept until 630am. Took another cab to school by 8am. I’ll remember this night.

9am still printing reports and then finally 1040am the FINAL SHOWDOWN! I thought it all went well... we did the basic circuits of 8 on land and water, brakes on ramp and reverse on ramp. But well since every Tom, Dick Harry can do it... well we are just average i guess... oh no i'm becoming pessimist like jazz!!! NO NO NO....i think we did well!!

Uh finally all is over. Thanks gals! You all have been great team mates!
