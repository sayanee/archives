Every time on my bus journey home from the gym, i'll see this building. And that day i actually decided to drop down and take a shot. Uh... the luxuries of having a bus pass when you are still a student. As the facade ofÂ the building reflected the clouds above, i got an idea for the title - Hard Reflection. And right now i feel this need to reflect upon myself... reflect really hard and steer away from distractions... school's opening soon in 2 weeks!
