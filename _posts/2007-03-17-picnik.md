Some of the features as said in their site:

- One-click photo fixing or in-depth tweaking
- Crop, rotate, and resize in real-time
- Tons of special effects, from artsy to fun
- Amazingly fast
- Works directly with many photo sharing sites
- No download required, nothing to install
- Works on Mac, Windows, even Linux
- Free version, premium version (soon)

sounds cool eh!
