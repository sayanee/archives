Like my previous notes on commencement speech, this is an equal gem to hear...

> will inertia be your guide or will you follow your passions? will you follow dogma or will you be orignal? will you choose a life of ease or a life of service and adventure? will you wilt under criticism or will you follow your convictions? will you bluff it out when you are wrong, or will you apologies? will you guard your heart against rejection or will you act when you fall in love?

In the end we are our choices, build yourself a great story.
