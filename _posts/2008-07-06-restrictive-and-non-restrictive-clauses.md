title: restrictive and non-restrictive clauses
---

**Restricitive Clauses** limit the possible meaning of a preceding subject. [uses _that,_ no comma]

**Nonrestrictive clauses** tell you something about a preceding subject, but they do not limit, or restrict, the meaning of that subject. [uses _which,_ with comma]

[For Example](http://www.kentlaw.edu/academics/lrw/grinker/LwtaClauses__Restrictive_and_Nonrest.htm), 

- Correct Restrictive Use: The store honored the complaints that were less than 60 days old. --> the store honored only those complaints less than 60 days old, but not those over 60 days old.
- Correct Nonrestrictive Use: The store honored the complaints, which were less than 60 days old. --> the store honored all the complaints, all of which were less than 60 days old.
