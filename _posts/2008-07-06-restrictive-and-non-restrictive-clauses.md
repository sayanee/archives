<strong>Restricitive Clauses</strong> limit the possible meaning of a preceding subject. [uses <em>that,</em> no comma]

<strong>Nonrestrictive clauses</strong> tell you something about a preceding subject, but they do not limit, or restrict, the meaning of that subject. [uses <em>which,</em> with comma]

<a href="http://www.kentlaw.edu/academics/lrw/grinker/LwtaClauses__Restrictive_and_Nonrest.htm">For Example</a>, 

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Correct Restrictive Use</span>: The store honored the complaints that were less than 60 days old. --&gt; the store honored only those complaints less than 60 days old, but not those over 60 days old.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Correct Nonrestrictive Use</span>: The store honored the complaints, which were less than 60 days old. --&gt; the store honored all the complaints, all of which were less than 60 days old.
