So what is the fundamental unit of all matter? Long ago, it was the molecules, then it was atoms... and then it was the electrons, protons and neutrons. Well, now there's something evern smaller - [quark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark). There are 6 flavours of quark and by the names, we surely know that phsycists are very imaginative and amusing:

1. up
2. down
3. top
4. bottom
5. charm
6. strange

Example, each proton is made up of two up quarks and one down quark. And along with quark, there are leptons and bosons making up the list of fundamental particles in particle physics science. Maybe s few years from now, we find find smaller divisions for quarks, leptons and bosons as well ;)
