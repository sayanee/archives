A [Pangram ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram)is a sentence that uses every letter of alphabet at least once! One very common example is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". Some [other Pangrams ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pangrams)which make sense are:


- Heavy boxes perform quick waltzes and jigs. (36 letters)
- A wizardâ€™s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog. (36 letters)
