A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram">Pangram </a>is a sentence that uses every letter of alphabet at least once! One very common example is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".

Some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pangrams">other Pangrams </a>which make sense are:
<ul>
	<li>
	<li>Heavy boxes perform quick waltzes and jigs. (36 letters)</li>
	<li>A wizardâ€™s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog. (36 letters)</li>
</li>
</ul>
