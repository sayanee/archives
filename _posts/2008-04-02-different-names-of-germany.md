<p align="justify">I was wondering why Germany has so many completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_Germany">different sounding names </a>for different languages. Eg. in German the country is known as <strong>Deutschland</strong>, in French as <strong>Allemagne,</strong> and in Polish as <strong>Niemcy</strong>. So in general i found there are 6 different names for Germany:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
<p align="justify">From Old High German: <em>diutisc</em> giving rise to <strong>Deutschland</strong></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="justify">From the Latin: <em>Germania </em>giving rise to <strong>Germany</strong></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="justify">From the name of the <em>Alamanni</em> tribe giving rise to <strong>Allemagne</strong></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="justify">From the name of the <em>Saxon</em> tribe giving rise to <strong>Saksa</strong></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="justify">From the Old Slavic word or the name of the Nemetes tribe, giving rise to <strong>Niemcy</strong></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="justify">From the Germanic word giving rise to <em><strong>V?cija</strong></em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">... making Germany the nation with many different names, with different tribes of people</p>
