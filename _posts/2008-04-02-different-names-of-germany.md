I was wondering why Germany has so many completely [different sounding names ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_Germany)for different languages. Eg. in German the country is known as **Deutschland**, in French as **Allemagne,** and in Polish as **Niemcy**. So in general i found there are 6 different names for Germany:

1. From Old High German: _diutisc_ giving rise to **Deutschland**
2. From the Latin: _Germania _giving rise to **Germany**
3. From the name of the _Alamanni_ tribe giving rise to **Allemagne**
4. From the name of the _Saxon_ tribe giving rise to **Saksa**
5. From the Old Slavic word or the name of the Nemetes tribe, giving rise to **Niemcy**
6. From the Germanic word giving rise to _**V?cija**_

... making Germany the nation with many different names, with different tribes of people
