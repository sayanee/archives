One of the most insightful articles I have seen recently is certain by [Ben Horowitz](http://bhorowitz.com/) (cofounder and General Partner along with Marc Andreessen, of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz). Here is [the entire blog post](http://bhorowitz.com/2010/04/28/why-we-prefer-founding-ceos/), with some of my fav quotes here:

List of founder CEOs...founders ran an overwhelming majority of them for a very long time, including:

- Acer—Stan Shih
- Adobe—John Warnock
- Amazon – Jeff Bezos
- AMD—Jerry Sanders III
- Apple – Steve Jobs
- DEC—Ken Olsen
- Dell—Michael Dell

Maximising vs finding product cycles...

> These innovations are product cycles. Professional CEOs are effective at **maximizing, but not finding,**product cycles**. Conversely, founding CEOs are excellent at **finding, but not maximizing,** product cycles. Our experience shows—and the data supports—that teaching a founding CEO how to maximize the product cycle is easier than teaching the professional CEO how to find the new product cycle.

Steve Jobs and the turn around...

> But remember that when Jobs returned to Apple in 1996, he was doing so as the co-founder and CEO of NeXT computer, a marginal computer workstation company which Apple purchased for less than $500M. Let’s just say he didn’t have the benefit of the doubt. What he did have: **the founder’s courage to innovate despite the doubters**.

I shall leave the rest for you to read on your own :)
