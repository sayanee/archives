One of the most insightful articles I have seen recently is certain by <a class="vt-p" href="http://bhorowitz.com/">Ben Horowitz</a> (cofounder and General Partner along with Marc Andreessen, of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz). Here is <a class="vt-p" href="http://bhorowitz.com/2010/04/28/why-we-prefer-founding-ceos/">the entire blog post</a>, with some of my fav quotes here:

List of founder CEOs:
<blockquote>...founders ran an overwhelming majority of them for a very long time, including:
- Acer—Stan Shih
- Adobe—John Warnock
- Amazon – Jeff Bezos
- AMD—Jerry Sanders III
- Apple – Steve Jobs
- DEC—Ken Olsen
- Dell—Michael Dell
- EA—Trip Hawkins
- EDS —Ross Perot
- Hewlett-Packard—Dave Packard
- IBM—Thomas Watson, Sr. (*)
- Intel—Andy Grove (*)
- Intuit—Scott Cook
- Microsoft —Bill Gates
- Motorola—Paul Galvin
- nVidia—Jen-Hsun Huan
- Oracle—Larry Ellison
- Peoplesoft—Dave Duffield
- Salesforce.com—Marc Benioff
- Seagate—Al Shugart
- Siebel—Tom Siebel
- Sony—Akio Morita
- Sun—Scott McNeely
- VMware—Diane Greene</blockquote>
Maximising vs finding product cycles...
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These innovations are product cycles. Professional CEOs are effective at <strong>maximizing, but not finding,</strong><strong>product cycles</strong>. Conversely, founding CEOs are excellent at <strong>finding, but not maximizing,</strong> <strong>product cycles</strong>. Our experience shows—and the data supports—that teaching a founding CEO how to maximize the product cycle is easier than teaching the professional CEO how to find the new product cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Steve Jobs and the turn around...</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But remember that when Jobs returned to Apple in 1996, he was doing so as the co-founder and CEO of NeXT computer, a marginal computer workstation company which Apple purchased for less than $500M. Let’s just say he didn’t have the benefit of the doubt. What he <strong>did </strong>have:<strong> the founder’s courage to innovate despite the doubters</strong>.</p>
