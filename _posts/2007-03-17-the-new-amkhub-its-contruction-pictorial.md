Guess what's my new hang out?? It's the new [AMK Hub ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMK_Hub):P

I was telling all my friends that i think i would visit this neighbourhood shopping centre even before [Vivo City ](http://www.vivocity.com.sg/home2.html)or the IKEA Sengkang Tampines- how true! For almost 5 years we have all been waiting and finally shops are opened... it's not officially opened yet. But still, i simply love it.

Now I can't wait for the new bus interchange and the entire shopping mall to be opened soon!  Surely all the AMK residents have been waiting for this... how it changed over the years...
