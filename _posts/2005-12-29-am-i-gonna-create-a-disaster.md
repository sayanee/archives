<p align="justify">SO all these while I thought I knew how to <font color="#990033">cook </font>until one day jazz, deeps and shab cornered me and asked, “How do you cook?” I answered, “Simple! Mom says put this and that...shake this and that...done!”. “Ok you dunno how to cook then” was the straight reply. <font color="#993300">WHAM!!!!....</font>ok so following instructions and cooking is not cooking... GREAT!!!</p>
<p align="justify">But today my mom went out and asked me to cook <font color="#660066">soya chicken</font>... ON MY OWN!!!!!!!!!!! Oh no my parents are not at home now... did I do everything correctly?</p>
The chicken...

<p align="justify">The extra ingredients... I cut them. The onions made me tear a lot, but nobody came to my rescue.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="349" src="/img/c2.jpg" height="259" style="width: 349px; height: 259px" /></p>

<p align="justify">Cooking cooking...stirring stirring...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/c5.jpg" /></p>
<p align="justify">Ok done... I made sure that I squeezed the chicken to see if it’s cooked and I tasted a bit. I think it’s quite nice. Now waiting for the final verdict from dad and mom... did I forget anything?!??! No right?? Oh no should I have put salt or more soya or less green chilli??? And so this was <font color="#663333">Sweska’s very truly first cooking – Soya Sauce Chicken</font></p>
