![](/img/pro.jpg) Uh…what a day!! Look at the time!!

I finally went out with the **X-Ko** to have just a short lunch. Well, it’s good to meet up for a short while than not at all right? Jokes flying away and crap was still in the air, but there was an undeniable sense of change within all of us…hee! ok they claimed I didn’t change much! We saw this old Chinese proverb…quite appropriate isn’t? All of us are moving further in different directions so fast…

Anyway, this really reminds me of the cartoon Pinky and the Brain…my classmates used to call me and HL by this…I think you all know who is the pinky right?? Amelia’s famous phrase still lingers in my mind, “Pinky says ‘what shall we do brain???’ Then Brain replies gravely, ‘we shall take over the world’!!!!” So what world are we talking about…our little past world of cedar of course!

It was a mind boggling day…but I finally got my piano to work!!! It plays the notes, but now must add in the extra features and another major task done about the software integration for our girl team! So many things that at one point of time I was screaming to everybody on the net….like this: UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!

Ooooooooffff that was good! More challenging things coming ahead in this week…and we shall overcome!

Good night! ![](http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/aetsch/cheeky-smiley-004.gif)
