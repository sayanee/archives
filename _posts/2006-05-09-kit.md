Just returned from the last badminton game with kit before she goes off to India. Thanks kit for all the badminton games, all the gym classes with fen also, all the bitching in the mango / guess dressing rooms, those chats for hours, the way our conversations just flow. I wish you all the best in Bombay aka Mumbai...

You are going to the land of Bollywood... please please do not forget to: 1. watch a hindi movie 2. take a photo with [Hrithik Roshan ](http://www.hrithikrules.com/)3. eat [golgappa](http://www.bawarchi.com/cookbook/fried3.html) and all sorts of chats and pickles and spices 4. stay safe and play safe and stay healthy 5. shop a hell lot 6. update your blog regularly and hopefully with pics 7. go to juhu beach 8. Travel to Agra, Goa + all around India to all those exotic places 9. Most importantly... Have fun!!!

I wish you all the best and you will come back safe with loads of memories and even more... And then Auntie Rika will cook Bengali dishes for you ;) thanks for everything kit... and oh youâ€™ll find your duck wing soon! Cheers to the friendship of Kit and Sweska for many more years to come...
