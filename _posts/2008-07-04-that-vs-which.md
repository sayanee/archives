When to use <em>that</em> and when to use <em>which</em>?

<strong>That</strong> introduces a restrictive clause, which is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">critical</span> to understanding the sentence because the clause defines its antecedent.
E.g. The brown house that has a rooftop is my favourite.

<strong>Which</strong> introduces nonrestrictive clause, which include information relevant but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not critical</span> to an understanding of the sentence.
E.g. The brown house, which has a rooftop, is my favourite.
