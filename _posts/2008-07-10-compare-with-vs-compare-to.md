title: ! '''Compare with'' vs ''Compare to'''
---

**Compare with** is used to place two things side by side for the purpose of examining their similarities or differences.

E.g. It is interesting to compare X with Y. **Compare to**Â used to assert that two things are alike.

E.g. The economy is compared to a running horse!
