wonderin...Â i didn't bother exploring this site until now?? There are simply brilliant talented artists out here in this forum sharing their works. And these are some of my favs...

- photoshop [actions](http://browse.deviantart.com/resources/applications/psactions/?order=9&startts=1174723200&endts=1177401600)
- photoshop [brushes](http://browse.deviantart.com/resources/applications/psbrushes/?order=9&alltime=yes)

Deviantart is like a community forum where all types of artists can display and share their work.
