wonderin...Â i didn't bother exploring this site until now?? There are simply brilliant talented artists out here in this forum sharing their works. And these are some of my favs...
<ul>
	<li>photoshop <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/resources/applications/psactions/?order=9&amp;startts=1174723200&amp;endts=1177401600">actions</a></li>
	<li>photoshop <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/resources/applications/psbrushes/?order=9&amp;alltime=yes">brushes</a></li>
</ul>
Deviantart is like a community forum where all types of artists can display and share their work.
