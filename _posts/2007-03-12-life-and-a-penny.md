A beautiful poem about life and money... found in the excerpts of Think and Grow rich by Napolean Hill...

> I bargained with Life for a penny, And Life would pay no more, However I begged at evening When I counted my scanty store. For Life is a just employer, He gives you what you ask, But once you have set the wages, Why, you must bear the task. I worked for a menialâ€™s hire, Only to learn, dismayed, That any wage I had asked of Life, Life would have willingly paid
