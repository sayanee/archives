<p align="justify">I'm spending the lazy afternoon away knitting. How's it?? :P nice?? It'll be a winter wear cap. I'm finally into the 20+ lines after making disastrous start on the first row. I think i re-knitted about 10 times before i finally got it - the tension, the counts and no more dropping holes... yeah! Mom has certainly been patient with me.</p>
<p align="left">And now the pattern is coming is to be pretty... guess i just gotta wait a while more before i can finally see the whole picture. Hold on... and mess will clear up soon ;)</p>
