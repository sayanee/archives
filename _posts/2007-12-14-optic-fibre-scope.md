Traditional wires are made of metal conductors and so if there's a damage or a break within the wire, a wire continuity test will show it easily.

But how do we check the quality of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber">Optic Fibre</a>? If there's a little dust or scratch within the optic fibre, the information will not travel fast and accurately within the optic fibre since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection">total internal reflection </a>is the main form of transmission.
