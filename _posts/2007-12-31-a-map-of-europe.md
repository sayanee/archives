saw this Europe map's interpretation in [strange maps](http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2007/12/23/227/), one of my fav blogs

![](/img/europe_map_olden1.jpg)

-  

**Prussia**, made to look like its walrus-bearded ‘Iron Chancellor’ Otto von Bismarck, is haranguing its neighbours: kneeling on Austria, a sleeping soldier in undress; covering the Netherlands with its right hand.

-  

**France**, dressed as a fierce zouave soldier, is aiming a bayonet at the heart of the unwieldy Prussian military monster.

-  

**Belgium**, too small to be anthropomorphised, is being squeezed between France and Prussia (which would become its familiar, if uncomfortable lot in the First and Second World Wars).

-  

**England** is an old woman, struggling with Ireland, her rebellious lapdog on a leash (although it looks more like a small bear); **Scotland** is the old lady’s mobcap.

-  

**Spain** is a rotund senorita, smoking the day away while lying on her back and thus nearly crushing the small Portuguese soldier under her.

-  

**Corsica** and Sardinia are joined to show a leprechaun-like figure gleefully mooning the map-reader.

-  

**Italy**, possibly made to look like the great national leader Garibaldi, is holding off pressure from Prussia.

-  

**Denmark** is a small, swaggering soldier, no doubt hoping to recover Holstein, the territory it lost to Prussia in a war a few years earlier.

-  

**Norway** and **Sweden** are together turned into a ferocious dog.

-  

**Switzerland** is a closed cottage.

-  

**Turkey** in Europe is “an Oriental crushed by the superincumbent pressure of the other countries”.

-  

**Turkey** in Asia is a girl smoking a hookah pipe.

-  

**Russia** is a rag-collector in a patched coat, ‘Crimea’ written on the patch sewn on last.
