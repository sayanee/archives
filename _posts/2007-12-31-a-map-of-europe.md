saw this Europe map's interpretation in <a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2007/12/23/227/">strange maps</a>, one of my fav blogs
<p align="center"><img src="/img/europe_map_olden1.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Prussia</strong>, made to look like its walrus-bearded ‘Iron Chancellor’ Otto von Bismarck, is haranguing its neighbours: kneeling on Austria, a sleeping soldier in undress; covering the Netherlands with its right hand.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>France</strong>, dressed as a fierce zouave soldier, is aiming a bayonet at the heart of the unwieldy Prussian military monster.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Belgium</strong>, too small to be anthropomorphised, is being squeezed between France and Prussia (which would become its familiar, if uncomfortable lot in the First and Second World Wars).</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>England</strong> is an old woman, struggling with Ireland, her rebellious lapdog on a leash (although it looks more like a small bear); <strong>Scotland</strong> is the old lady’s mobcap.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Spain</strong> is a rotund senorita, smoking the day away while lying on her back and thus nearly crushing the small Portuguese soldier under her.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Corsica</strong> and Sardinia are joined to show a leprechaun-like figure gleefully mooning the map-reader.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Italy</strong>, possibly made to look like the great national leader Garibaldi, is holding off pressure from Prussia.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Denmark</strong> is a small, swaggering soldier, no doubt hoping to recover Holstein, the territory it lost to Prussia in a war a few years earlier.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Norway</strong> and <strong>Sweden</strong> are together turned into a ferocious dog.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Switzerland</strong> is a closed cottage.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Turkey</strong> in Europe is “an Oriental crushed by the superincumbent pressure of the other countries”.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Turkey</strong> in Asia is a girl smoking a hookah pipe.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p align="left"><strong>Russia</strong> is a rag-collector in a patched coat, ‘Crimea’ written on the patch sewn on last.</p>
</li>
</ul>
