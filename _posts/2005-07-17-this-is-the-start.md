yes! Even I have started blogging...after much contemplation. I was pestering Anand and Jazz…should I blog or not. Recently, due to the much free time in my internship, I started reading my friends' blogs. In a weird way it was teaching me about life…about love, about friends, about family and regrets. Yes, I do put down my thoughts in total privacy…but hey!…suddenly I want the whole word to know?? Why?…as Villa was saying Blogs are **oxymoron**….yeah in a way…

 I wrote down my thoughts since primary school…let’s see what blogging does to me! But this blog will remain a secret…till I want my friends to know about it…let’s see when that time will come.
