title: Mathematics in Paintings
---

I'm reading a book on [Golden Ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)... that's a blog for another day. But as i was reading i came across 2 very intriguing paintings and the mathematics behind them.

First one is _ [Melancholia I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholia_I)_ by [Albrecht Durer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer). If we observe carefully, we can see the elements of maths embedded in this...
- tolls of geometry and architecture - compass, hour glass, scale,  truncated rhombohedron
- The 4 × 4 [magic square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square), with the two middle cells of the bottom row giving the date of the engraving: 1514
- comet and the rainbow

but, for me the most intriguing element has to be the magic square on the top right hand corner!

And the second one is by [Jacopo de' Barbari ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacopo_de%27_Barbari)depicting [Luca Pacioli ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_pacioli)giving lesson in geometry to a pupil. One of the Platonic Solids, a [dodecahedron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron), is seen on the right resting on top of Pacioli's book, Summa. Pacioli himself, dressed in his friar robes is copying a diagram from volume XIII of [Euclid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid)'s [Elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements). A live demonstration of perspective drawing!
