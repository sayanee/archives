<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

so what exactly are Pink Elephants?
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Let me quote Richard Nixon, President of the United States, in a televised address to the nation in April 1973: "There can be <strong>no</strong> whitewash at the White-house.' Until that point, the American people refused to believe that their president could have had any prior knowledge of the break-in at the Democratic Party HQ at the Watergate Building. That on phrase, linking the White House with whitewash reversed their thinking.</p>
<p align="justify">i'm <strong>not</strong> eating my crayons</p>
<p align="justify">there can be <strong>no</strong> whitewash at the White House</p>
<p align="justify">I did <strong>not</strong> have sexual relation with that woman</p>
<p align="justify">I <strong>didn't</strong> stand on the radiator</p>
</blockquote>
Every picture tells a story
<ol>
	<li>Speak in vivid pictures to paint clear descriptions</li>
	<li>Use analogies to turn abstract concepts and jargon into bright pictures</li>
	<li>Avoid talking above or below your audience's level. Instead talk to their level</li>
</ol>
sorry seems to be the hardest word...
<ol>
	<li>saying sorry is the best way to start rebuilding confidence in your relationship after something has gone wrong</li>
	<li>we respect those who apologise - and lose respect for those who pretend to be infallible</li>
	<li>regret, reason and remedy offers an apology, explanation and solution. It manages expectation, which must then be met</li>
</ol>
Thank you and well done...
<ol>
	<li>saying 'thank you' and well-done demonstrates your appreciation. It raises your self-confidence and that of the person you're thanking</li>
	<li>it builds loyalty, while lack of recognition builds indifference</li>
</ol>
who looks stupid when you criticize in public?
<ol>
	<li>destructive criticism of children and adults alike destroys their self confidence and often turns them into critics themselves</li>
	<li>only offer criticism privately - and ensure you're able to explain how things can be done better</li>
	<li>humour's great!</li>
</ol>
Flush out the watering words...
<ol>
	<li>remove words that dilute your message - words like 'quite', 'relatively', 'hopefully'...</li>
	<li>'i'll do my best' and 'i'll try' both lack firm commitment</li>
</ol>
create deeper understanding...
<ol>
	<li>listen carefully to the person you are talking with</li>
	<li>contribute to the conversation in a meaningful way, rather than just waiting to butt in</li>
	<li>use body language and the tone of your voice to add conviction to your well-chosen words</li>
</ol>
