<strong>Active Voice</strong> is usually preferred.

<strong>Passive Voice - </strong>the subject receives the action and it might have the phrase "by the...". Passive Voice is usually avoided except in 2 cases:
<ol>
	<li>Subject of the sentence is indefinite/general.
E.g. Rice is not grown in these fields (good). They do not grow rice in these fields (poor)</li>
	<li>Depends on what the writer emphasises.
E.g. America was discovered by Columbus. or Columbus discovered America.</li>
