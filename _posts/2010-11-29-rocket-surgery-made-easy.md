<strong>Book Title:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292">Rocket Surgery Made Easy</a>
<strong> Author: </strong>Steve Krug
<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

Things to do:
<blockquote>First you choose the tasks to test the things you want them to try
Then you exapnd these tasks into scenarios - the little scripts that add any details of context they'll need to know to do the tasks.</blockquote>
2 restrictions:
<blockquote>Don't use the search
Stay on this site</blockquote>
6 Principles
<blockquote>A morning a month that's all we ask
Start earlier than you think makes sense
recruit loosely and grade on the curve
Make it a spectator sport
Focus ruthlessly on a small number of the most important problems
when fixing problems, always do the least you can do.</blockquote>
