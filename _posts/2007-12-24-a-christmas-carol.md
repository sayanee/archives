<p align="justify">it's nostalgic... the way we used to decorate the christmas tree, prepare rigorously for the special christmas performance and that year it was the fairy tale... Cinderella. Thank you for putting up with my debut directorship. Our parents were all delighted, but i teared because i thought it was a disaster... the servant <em>had </em>to go to pee when he was about to put the shoe on Cinderella's shoes, the Prince and the Cinderalla <em>had</em> to start quarelling on stage because the Prince was counting out the waltz beats so loudly... and Cinderella <em>had</em> to refuse to clean the floor!!! Oh my my.... but now i know better... it was probably my best ever being a director :P</p>
Presenting to you...
