Now i have all my contacts beautifully synced up across <strong>Address Book</strong>, <strong>Google Contacts</strong> and <strong>iPhone</strong> with a little bit of help from the iTunes sync. Before this i had contacts with only the phone numbers in my iPhone, while the Google contacts would have the emails.

After spending 5 hours doing this, i just had to share this out... :P Here's what i did...

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Transfer iPhone contacts and MAC Address Book contacts to Google contact</span>
This can be done via iPhone sync with the<strong> <span style="color: #800000;">iTunes -&gt; Info tab -&gt; Contacts and Advanced</span></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-485    aligncenter" src="/img/iTunes-sync.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-490 alignnone" src="/img/iTunes-sync21.jpg" alt="" />

...and Address Book sync with the Google contact. Go to the <strong><span style="color: #800000;">Address Book menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Synchronize with Google</span></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-487" src="/img/Address-Book-sync.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-489" src="/img/Address-Book-sync3.jpg" alt="Address-Book-sync3" width="498" height="254" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-488" src="/img/Address-Book-sync2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Ensure all the contacts are in the Google contacts</span>
This is really important to ensure no contacts are lost. "All Contacts" in the Google contacts should be much higher with additional contacts from the iPhone and Address Book!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-491" src="/img/Screen-shot-2009-11-28-at-AM-06.52.16.jpg" alt="" />

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Organise all contacts in Google</span>
Now the best part is to merge the contacts! In Google contacts, we can select multiple contacts and merge them! So multiple phone and emails can now be under just one contact.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-492" src="/img/google-merge.jpg" alt="" />

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Clean up Address Book - delete all contacts</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Clean up iPhone contacts - delete all contacts by syncing with iTunes. </span>
This time, uncheck the Google Sync and sync with only the Address Book, so that it has no contacts.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-493" src="/img/delete-iPhone-Contacts.jpg" alt="" />

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">6.Â  Address Book and iPhone should have no contacts stored. </span>
Finally, transfer all contacts in the Google contacts to the group called "My Contacts". <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Select all contacts -&gt; Move to My Contacts</strong></span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-494" title="my-contacts" src="/img/my-contacts.jpg" alt="my-contacts" width="428" height="90" />
7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sync up iPhone with iTunes like in Step 1.</span>

Now they are all in sync. If i add a new contact in Google, after the sync it will appear in iPhone and Address Book. :D
