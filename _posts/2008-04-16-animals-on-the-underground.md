[London Underground](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2625.aspx) metro is so dense, that by connecting the points of stations some pretty cool [animals can be drawn out](http://www.animalsontheunderground.com/the_animals.html)! Reminds of how the ancient people once connected the stars above to creat objects of their own imagination as well.
