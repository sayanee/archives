Let me count how much i walked today... the whole of sector 1 and 7, including the RT tracks. = 5.7 km approximately

And these are the times when i reach the final beacon and look back at the long winding tunnel behind me and wonder how i did it all...

one step at a time.

Think i can coin a phrase right now... 'life's like a winding long tunnel. You never know what you'll expect at the next bend.'

\*yawn\* i'm totally tired out... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
