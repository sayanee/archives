<p align="left">Let me count how much i walked today... the whole of sector 1 and 7, including the RT tracks.
= 5.7 km approximately
<p align="justify">And these are the times when i reach the final beacon and look back at the long winding tunnel behind me and wonder how i did it all...</p>
<p align="justify">one step at a time.</p>
<p align="justify">Think i can coin a phrase right now... 'life's like a winding long tunnel. You never know what you'll expect at the next bend.'</p>
<p align="justify">*yawn* i'm totally tired out... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</p>
