cos i like this song :) Once upon A time I saw you walk along A moonbeam; what a lovely girl I followed you around the world (O-uh oh oh) Chorus: I love you, don't you see You stole my heart in 1-2-3 I love you, yes it's true You stole my heart and I'm gonna steal yours too April, June And underneath a harvest moon I dream in sleep I'm taking flight An aeroplane across the night I love you, don't you see You stole my heart in 1-2-3 I love you, yes it's true You stole my heart and I'm gonna steal yours too
