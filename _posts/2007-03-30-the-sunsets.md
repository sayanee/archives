Can u see the grace behind the grains?? i can! 

I probably saw the last sunset from the rooftop yesterday. It's a huge relief that i won't have to see any more sunsets, but the memories of open rooftop sunsets in total solitude and silence will remain as one of my deepest memories. And a thought came to my mind if i'll cherish the sunrise as much as sunsets. What's the difference anyway? Can you tell if it's a sunrise or a sunset from the sky?

Think i'll be sticking to sunsets for a long time to come...
