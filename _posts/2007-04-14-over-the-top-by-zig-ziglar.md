You are at the top when...
<ol>
	<li>You clearly understand that failure is an event, not a person; that yesterday ended last night, and today is your brand new day</li>
	<li>You have made friends with your past. are focused on the present, and optimistic about your future</li>
	<li>You know that success (a win) doesn't make you, and failure (a loss) doesn't break you</li>
	<li>You are filled with faith, hope and love; and love without anger, greed, envy or thoughts or revenge</li>
	<li>You are mature enough to delay gratification and shift your focus from your rights to your responsibilities</li>
	<li>You know that failure to stand for what is morally right is the prelude to being the victim of what is criminally wrong</li>
	<li>You are secure in who you are, so you are at peace with God and in the fellowship with man</li>
	<li>You have made friends of your adversaries and have gained the love and respect of those who know you best</li>
	<li>You understand that others can give you pleasure, but genuine happiness comes when you do things for others</li>
	<li>You are pleasant to the grouch, courteous to the rude and generous to the needy</li>
	<li>You love the unlovable, give hope to the hopeless, friendship to the friendless, and encouragement to the discouraged</li>
	<li>You can look back in forgiveness, forward in hope, down in compassion, and up with gratitude</li>
	<li>You know that 'he who would be the greatest among you must become the servant of all'</li>
	<li>You recognise, confess, develop and use your God-given physical, metal and spiritual abilities to the glory of God and for the benefit of mankind</li>
	<li>You stand in front of the creator of the universe and He says to you, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."</li>
</ol>
And here's a paragraph about happiness... so true!
<blockquote>Many people honestly believe they will be happy when they get into a home of their own; they will be happy when they get all of the little things that frequently convert a house to a home and have them neatly in place 0 but they won't. Then they'll be happy when they add the patio and the outdoor barbecue grill 0 but they won't. Then they'll be happy when they get the mortgage paid 0 but they won't....

The reason is simple: It makes no difference where you go, there you are. And it makes no difference what you have, there's always more to want.

Happines is not a when or a where, it can be now and here.</blockquote>
