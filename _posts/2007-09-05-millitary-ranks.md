I often get confused in the hierarchy of the [Millitary rank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_rank) names. Of course, it isÂ complex and there are many different types for different cultures and army, navy, air force.. so here's it in really brief...

1. Field Marshal
2. General
3. Brigadier
4. Colonel
5. Lieutenant Colonel
6. Major
7. Captain
8. Lieutenant
9. Warrant Officer
10. Sergeant
11. Corporal
12. Private
