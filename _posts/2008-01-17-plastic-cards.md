<p align="justify"><img align="left" src="/img/cards1.jpg" />so i got them all… 4 of ‘em including the one i kept hearing since cedar days - the men don’t get it. and i’m wondering what to do with them now.</p>
<p align="justify">You see… i hardly buy clothes or stuff (mom or dad buys them for me anyway). Shoes, wallets, hp and now even laptops last for 5 years. And so… even <em>if </em>in rare case i do buy something, it’ll cost almost always near to a 1000 bucks… expensive expediture. And now rather than busy buying i'm busy settling all sorts of tokens, internet userIDs and passwords... i'm utterly confused!!</p>
<p align="justify">what to buy.. what to buy... what to buy... **scratching head**</p>
