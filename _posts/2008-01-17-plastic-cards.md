so i got them all… 4 of ‘em including the one i kept hearing since cedar days - the men don’t get it. and i’m wondering what to do with them now.

You see… i hardly buy clothes or stuff (mom or dad buys them for me anyway). Shoes, wallets, hp and now even laptops last for 5 years. And so… even _if _in rare case i do buy something, it’ll cost almost always near to a 1000 bucks… expensive expediture. And now rather than busy buying i'm busy settling all sorts of tokens, internet userIDs and passwords... i'm utterly confused!!

what to buy.. what to buy... what to buy... \*\*scratching head\*\*
