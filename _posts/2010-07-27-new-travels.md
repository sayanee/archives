Good day to end of July and hello to my new home :)

I had to make this little shift in the age where our names in the virtual world is who we are. With [a little help from Estonia](http://www.eestiinternet.ee/eng/news/new-domain-system-comes-into-effect-in-estonia/_year/2010), I'm very happy to have a [domain hack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack) that is truly me :P Having returned from a whirlwind 2 months of travels, I'm ever more inspired to learn, connect and most importantly initiate projects.
