<p align="justify">Ok this is weird. I am lazy to cook, but if i go without cooking for a few days, there's this urge to cook a little something in the comfort of my room. And after heeding mom and dad's consistent reminders about eating balanced meal i cooked one just now :P</p>
<p align="justify">Pasta sauce is clearly the lazy people's way of cooking :P Not too bad... here's my easy lazy tasty dinner done in just 3 steps! And i opened another bar of Belgian Chocolate <em>Noir </em>for dessert<em>.</em> <em>Bon App√©tit!</em></p>
