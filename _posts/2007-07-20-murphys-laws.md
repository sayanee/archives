this is funny... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy's Laws</a>...
<ol>
	<li>If anything can go wrong, it will.</li>
	<li>If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong.</li>
	<li>If anything just cannot go wrong, it will anyway.</li>
	<li>If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which something can go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will promptly develop.</li>
	<li>Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse.</li>
	<li>If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.</li>
	<li>Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.</li>
	<li>Whatever has happened wrong, is bound to happen again .... maybe even worse.</li>
</ol>
