2005... no fancy achievements, no exciting travels... just a plain year spent in Singapore.

**Jan - Apr -> Semester 2 of year 2**

Had great fun doing MNO project with huiling, kang hao, suan bin and shao rong for Russell Food Fusion. We got A even after the unforgettable series of unfortunate events!! Also cannot forget the over nights spent with des, huiling and alvin doing the digital design bread board project where almost everybody got A... but the nights were really fun wiring and me and huiling trying to 'duplicate'...ooopppss!!!

**May to Jul -> Internship at A\*STAR IBN**

**Coding with MATLAB for Multiple Particle Tracking with JAzz and going to play badminton and jogging after work in NUSHow to forget WX, Jackie and Noreena! And those lunch breaks at soul food, holland V or even the pantry with free tea and coffee.

**Aug to Nov -> Semester 1 of Year 3**

**Another great project EE3001 with 8 gals in a group...we got As and A+s. Great team dynamics, perseverance and creativity!And not to mention the duet piano project with jazz.

**Dec -> Holidays**

Holidays = friends outings = fun stuff to do = family time = future planning = free time!!But i learnt about some of my inner thinkings...

**Friendship**

Realised that time heals a lot of things, but time does not let you forget so easily. It's really great that I am able to still keep in touch with good old friends and hope so for many more years to come... you all are too precious to loose. As time pass by the passion of friendship dilutes... but we gotta just keep rekindling it coz life is just too short! I truly didn't realise the power of friendship until this year... it can overcome a lot of hesitation and awkwardness. The power of just a smile and a simple hi is really omnipotent. Also not everybody is blessed with good peer influence, but I am.

**Goals**

This is like always changing and at every point when you realise a certain strength or weakness your goals change. I don't even know what I’ll be doing in 2 years time... And to think after these 1.5 years you are entering the working life. But whatever I do in future, I hope i can provide my parents a good life... they had a very tiring life and they need a refreshing and relaxing life ahead.

**Blessings**

I am glad i never complain about life and consider myself so fortunate... because I truly am. My parents, my friends, my relatives, my education, my hobbies, my privacy, my room, my access to technology and my rights are all the very best in the world. But I am still not able to answer this question even until today: Why are some so much unluckier than I am...why?? I feel very useless I cannot do anything for those earthquake or tsunami or AIDS....too many, too far away and too much.

**Prejudices**

Sometimes you bear some sort of prejudice against a certain group of people. If you have such a prejudice, make a friend out of this prejudiced group and you might just learn something powerful. I used to feel awkward about homosexuals until I shockingly discovered 3 of my friends are one. I learnt to see from another point of view... I'm not willing to loose their friendship in any way...never! A few other prejudices were similarly broken...back to the point that friendship is really powerful.

**Silence**

Sometimes people say a lot of things even without speaking a single word... and even in silence you just drift away further than a stranger. Maybe true feelings will stand the test of time and silence. But after too long silence is bad... we should speak up!

**Solitude**

I'm used to being around people and moving around here and there in gangs. Cannot sit alone in library to study, cannot sit alone in canteen to eat... cannot walk alone... must be in big gangs. I still remember how that whiny KT whined after 1st 3 months in JC and made me also cry because we missed our class. But in life one has to learn to be in solitude and walk alone and let go... I’ve learnt it. Sometimes it's good to appreciate your solitude... its different from loneliness. Solitude...

**Destiny**

Is there such a thing?? I know you can control some things like your CAP or GPA, but what about things you cannot control? You cannot control death, you cannot control who you meet and you cannot control who you did not meet before. Chance - sometimes you simply just do not have it.

**Pride**

So one should be proud of who you are... What is the true meaning of being proud of your identity? Is it always being associated with the recognised or is it embracing the unfortunate of that group? Which is more important?? I have learnt that embracing the unfortunate is more important because after all who doesn't want to be associated with the best and the recoginsed?? I'm humbled by their laughter and joy... they teach me so much.

**Instincts**

I think I have good instincts. I know how much hard work done will yield how much. I kept saying that our all gals group will do well because we worked really hard...I’m really proud of them. And yes we got the highest grade A+ \*muaks\* VelTech!!! I hope this instinct will carry me throughout my life.So, let me see if i'll be filling in with any more exciting stuff... to know i'll just have to plunge into **2006**...here I come!!!!!!

**HAPPY NEW YEAR FRIENDS!!!**
