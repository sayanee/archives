I got a lovely yellow rose this year, so I decided to capture it and share the friendship... :)

This yellow flower is for all my online friendships that I have made/continued over the past year! Whether they are [ twitter peeps](http://twitter.com/sweska/following) or the [tech 65 gang](http://www.tech65.org/) or the [creative crew](http://www.creativecrew.org.sg/) bunch or [Challenge:Future](http://www.challengefuture.org/) and many many more... Living at this age with Social media, Skype, iPhone, live streaming and constant 24 hours connectivity, no matter where you are, it's always so near!

Thank you for the wonderful friendship around the world!
