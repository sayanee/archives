I can bring in 2 X A4 size papers. And after horrendous squeezing, i have a lot of white spaces left! So, i'll squeeze in the tutorials as well. Not that it'll help me much anyway.

And with this, i'm done with all the comp stuff - reading forums, printing exam papers, watching webcasts. So, this laptop is going into the cupboard for the next one week coz if it stays beside me, it's obviously fatal! I hope, declaring this to the whole world will make me stay away from it :P

Hang in there pals... exams will be all over soon!!
