Research has shown that 80% of what you store, you will NEVER use it again.

De-clutter your life, throw away useless things to simply life. Get rid of excess junk at home.
<blockquote>Out of clutter, find simplicity
--Albert Einstein</blockquote>
Look around and ask youself these questions:
<ol>
	<li>Do I really love this?</li>
	<li>Does this item make my life better or easier?</li>
	<li><strong>Have I used it in the past year? </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Will I really ever use this again?</strong></li>
</ol>
If any of these answers are NO, it's time to throw them away.
