title: Clutter free living

Research has shown that 80% of what you store, you will NEVER use it again. De-clutter your life, throw away useless things to simply life. Get rid of excess junk at home.

> Out of clutter, find simplicity --Albert Einstein

Look around and ask yourself these questions:

1. Do I really love this?
2. Does this item make my life better or easier?
3. **Have I used it in the past year?**
4. **Will I really ever use this again?**

If any of these answers are NO, it's time to throw them away. Read more about the value in having a clutter free home:
