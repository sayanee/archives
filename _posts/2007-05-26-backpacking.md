Travelling for me is ideally by backpacking. Yep! I think via backpacking i can truly see the people, culture, food and places of that country. but of course i have never done that before :p So here are a few really interesting links that i found about how to backpack, things to bring, what to take note of etc… and i’m really surprised at the wealth of info available!

- [backpacking guide](http://www.the-backpacking-site.com/index.html)
- [backpacking.net](http://www.backpacking.net/)
- [backpacking light](http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/index.html)
- [the backpacker](http://www.thebackpacker.com/)
- [hiking and backpacking guide](http://gorp.away.com/gorp/activity/hiking.htm)

yes one day i’m really gonna venture out and immerse in backpacking!!
