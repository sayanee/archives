<strong>Book Title:</strong> The Richest Man in Babylon
<strong>Author:</strong>George S. Clason
<strong>Year written/published:</strong> 1926
<strong>Summary:</strong> This book is in a story form set in the scene of the ancient Babylon.
<strong>My Comments:</strong> I found this book really different from other technical Finance books. I loved the way the concept was being simplified through gold coins and of course we have to relate it back to modern currency and stock systems. I read it like a thin short story book and it was enjoyable… had to read it slowly coz of the ‘ancient’ English. <img src="http://buibui.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<strong>Some extracts:</strong>

Forward…
<blockquote>Money is the medium by which earthly success is measured

Money makes possible the enjoyment of the best the earth affords

Money is plentiful for those who understand the simple laws which govern its acquisition

Money is governed today by the same laws which controlled it when prosperous men which controlled it when prosperous men thronged the streets of Babylon, 6000 years ago</blockquote>
on fickle fate.. or sudden luck!
<blockquote>Fickle Fate is a vicious goddess who brings no permanent good to anyone. On the contrary, she bring ruin to almost every man upon whom she showers unearned gold. She makes wanton spenders, who soon dissipate all they received and are left beset by overwhelming appetites and desires they have not the ability to gratify.</blockquote>
simple rules..
<blockquote>Lo, Money is plentiful for those who understand the Simple rules of its acquisition
<ol>
	<li>Start thy purse to flattening</li>
	<li>Control thy expenditure</li>
	<li>Make thy gold multiply</li>
	<li>Guard the treasures from loss</li>
	<li>Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment</li>
	<li>Insure a future income</li>
	<li>Increase thy ability to earn</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
other values…
<blockquote>A part of all you earn is yours to keep

Men of action are favoured by the Goddess of good luck

Better a little caution than a great regret

We cannot afford to be without adequate protection

Where the determination is, the way can be found.</blockquote>
5 laws of Gold:
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than 1/10 of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of family</li>
	<li>Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.</li>
	<li>Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of wise men in its handling</li>
	<li>Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep</li>
	<li>Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the allurance advice of tricksters and schemers or who trust it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment </li>
</ol>
