something dropped out of the drawer while i was clearing it... tada!! my first competitive 10km run and i survived it well in a slightly above average timing :P I dunno what made me run all the way to the finishing line even though i have never done it, even while 'training' for it. Maybe the fact that 4000 other gals were running with me made me reach for the finishÂ as well...
