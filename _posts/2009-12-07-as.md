A+S = Analysis + Structuring I have been an information gatherer mostly. And gathering tons of information is easy. But can we naturally come up with a clear, short, easy understanding of any subject. In essence, can we explain what we have learnt to a 5 year old? Can we explain our 2-year thesis in one page diagrammatic slide? I got a glimpse of these tools and techniques through the [workshop i have been attending](http://web.mac.com/danonthe/A+S/Introduction.html)... it was an insight!

But the most fun part is how we can actually create our own [frameworks](http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/) like the commonly known [4Ps](http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_marketing_mix.html) and [BCG Matrix](http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_bcgmatrix.html) to beautifully synthesize our understanding of any topic. When we can do that on a daily basis, then it truly reflects our understanding wrapped up in just one page or a simple acronym.

So in summary, my biggest take-away from this workshop would be to **develop my own framework**. Now, i never really thought of processing chunks of information in this manner!
