<p align="justify"><strong>Happy 2nd year anniversary genies!!!</strong> And <strong>Happy 21st b day to lh, jas and hl!</strong> Finally had a big big gathering and there were 12 of us. We ate at Swenson’s in suntec and had a double celebration – the b days and our 2nd year anniversary. Lh sadly couldn’t come…and jas finally came!! Miss that gal…and now she’s going away to Germany in a month’s time. Must bring back German hunks’ photos ok?? Haha!!</p>
<p align="justify"><img border="0" align="left" src="/img/g_1.jpg" hspace="10" />Genies have definitely added much colour to my undergrad life…being part of my lectures, tutorials, project groups and those late nights doing bread board wiring…and then incessant suaning…I love them either way!!!! Remember the all girls’ team that I’m part of? Yeah there are 5 genie gals here too! I would especially like to thank des! Many times as years go by it becomes difficult to meet and it kind of dies down…but des has always been the one to initiate these outing and rekindle everything about the way we first started out! So thank you des for all your initiatives and these outings…</p>
<p align="justify">And hopefully more such outings for many more years to come…and then we can also start celebrating our 30th b days :) As josh says now we’ll be reaching 30 years before we know it…this is life man...</p>
