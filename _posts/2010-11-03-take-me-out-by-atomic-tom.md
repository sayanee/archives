If I was bold enough
I would follow you forever
but darling please
rescue me take me out

some may say
it's my fate
am i just in time
or am i late
if you can understand
then

Take me out
I don't start I don't end
I don't change on my own
Take me out
I don't lose i don't win
I don't do well alone

Love is what you make it
Take my heart and break it
Take me out
I don't want to stay home

you make me dread
you make me sweat
busdt can you make
love mean something instead
something real make me feel
then

i don't want to stay here
i don't wanna live half my life
and disappear
so if you want to take chances
take a chance on me

take me out
