If I was bold enough <br>
I would follow you forever <br>
but darling please rescue me <br>
take me out <br>
some may say <br>
it's my fate <br>
am i just in time or am i late <br>
if you can understand then <br>
Take me out <br>
I don't start <br>
I don't end <br>
I don't change on my own <br>
Take me out <br>
I don't lose <br>
i don't win <br>
I don't do well alone <br>
Love is what you make it <br>
Take my heart and break it <br>
Take me out <br>
I don't want to stay home <br>
you make me dread <br>
you make me sweat busdt <br>
can you make love mean something instead something real <br>
make me feel then i don't want to stay here <br>
i don't wanna live half my life and <br>
disappear so if you want to take chances <br>
take a chance on me take me out <br>
