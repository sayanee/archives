[Neuro-Linguistic Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming)... the aphorisms
- The map is not the territory
- Life and 'Mind' are Systemic Processes
- Behind every behavior is a positive intention
- Rapport is necessary for effective communication
- There is no failure, only feedback
- Choice is better than no choice (and flexibility is the way one gets choice)
- The meaning of the communication is in the response
- People already have all the resources they need to succeed
- Multiple descriptions are better than one
