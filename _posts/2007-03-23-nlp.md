<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">Neuro-Linguistic Programming</a>... the aphorisms
<ul>
	<li>The map is not the territory</li>
	<li>Life and 'Mind' are Systemic Processes</li>
	<li>Behind every behavior is a positive intention</li>
	<li>Rapport is necessary for effective communication</li>
	<li>There is no failure, only feedback</li>
	<li>Choice is better than no choice (and flexibility is the way one gets choice)</li>
	<li>The meaning of the communication is in the response</li>
	<li>People already have all the resources they need to succeed</li>
	<li>Multiple descriptions are better than one</li>
</ul>
