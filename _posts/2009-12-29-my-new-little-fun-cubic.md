<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-567" src="/img/cubic-logo-transparent-200.png" alt="" align="left" />Ok! Here it goes... after a few months of secrecy and setting up, I have finally decided to say that my new project in partnership with a friend is online now!

Project <a href="http://cubic.chin.ee/">Cubic</a> is about capturing moments with a little Haiku.

Each post will have 2 pictures from 2 corners of the world, but they will always say the same message... can you decipher it? :p

And we would love to hear your comments and ideas!

For now, let me start you off with a lovely picture of silver balls from 2 faraway places - that sure signals gorgeousness, festivity and brilliance for the next year coming for us. Enjoy exploring project <a href="http://cubic.chinnee.net/index.php">Cubic</a>, by Chinnee!
