One of my favourite poems by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost">Robert Frost</a>... and yes, it's something to think about. The road not taken in life...
<blockquote>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
And sorry I could not travel both 
And be one traveler, long I stood 
And looked down one as far as I could 
To where it bent in the undergrowth;         
 
Then took the other, as just as fair, 
And having perhaps the better claim, 
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; 
Though as for that the passing there 
Had worn them really about the same,         
 
And both that morning equally lay 
In leaves no step had trodden black. 
Oh, I kept the first for another day! 
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, 
I doubted if I should ever come back.         
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh 
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
<font color="#008000">Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.</font></blockquote>
