It was almost 3 years back that i set myself to [read one book every 3 days](http://sweska.net/2007/02/15/b-b/)! And yes, eventually i did [manage to read 100 books](http://share.sweska.net/category/book-reviews/) for the year 2007 as I was only a student with loads of free time. Over the years, i started to get a lot of reading content from feeds and podcasts as well, and naturally the book count went down. So i have reviewed my reading rate to make it sustainable for the long term - It shall be one book per week! With the 5 remaining weeks of the year 2009, i have a line-up of very interesting books to read during the quiet Sunday afternoons or during the long commuting hours. ![books-to-read](/img/books-to-read.jpg) **Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan** This book is in the league of science and philosophy and it reminds me of authors like Richard Feynman or Stephen Hawking and i have loved reading these authors. Should be an interesting read! **Great Speeches of Modern India **I bought this book at Crosswords in Kolkata, but never had the chance to read it. It is filled with speeches from Gandhi, Nehru during the pre-independence days to Amartya Sen and Sonia Gandhi today. It will really give me a glimpse of thoughts behind the leaders of India. **Time Traveler's Wife** I wanted to see the movie but i have not watched it yet!! While watching the trailer i knew i had to read this romantic novel. And no, i ain't a romantic novel lover :P **Rise and Fall of Third Reich** This book is undoubtedly one of the master pieces of WWII history. It's a very thick book and so i think I will take some time on this one. But it should provide a lot of insights on the world today. **Smashing Magazine Book** I [bought this book online](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/05/the-smashing-book-pre-order-now-and-save-20/)!! I have always loved reading their online posts on design and web and i'm very sure the book will be great! But i'm waiting for it to be shipped to me :) So i shall put this as the last book to read for the year 2009! So there are the 5 books - it has a great mix of science, history and design. I shall start with the Pale Blue Dot, the earth that we stay on...
