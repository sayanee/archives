<p align="justify">Remember playing boardgames? I loved Monopoly and Scotland Yard. Now i found out another new type of board game - <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-US&amp;ie=utf8&amp;oe=utf8&amp;q=cashflow+101">Cashflow 101</a> developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kiyosaki">Robert Kiyosaki</a> to teach us about financial strategies and accounting principles. It would be especially interesting to know how we can actually get out of the Rat Race in the game... well as they say... the games we play are actually the reflections of our life!</p>
<p align="justify">And some interesting link about the game ...</p>
