Sweska Says... about her ramblings of life!

And so, she is moving on to the next stage of her life. Having just graduated as an electrical engineer merely 7 months back in Singapore, she is enjoying her new-found freedom, excitement at work and travelling around the world, meeting loads of people and having fun ;)

Life's  simply a bliss right now!!
