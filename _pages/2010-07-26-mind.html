We have a right to our labor but not to the fruits of our labor.
~ Krishna to Arjun, Mahabharata

It may help to think of it this way. If you were meant to cure cancer or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don't do it, you not only hurt yourself, even destroy yourself. You hurt your children. You hurt me. You hurt the planet.
You shame the angels who watch over you and you spite the Almighty, who created you and only you with your unique gifts, for the sole purpose of nudging the human race one millimeter farther along its path back to God.
Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It's a gift to the world and every being in it. Don't cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you've got.
~ War of Art

The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. No big laboratory is needed in which to think.

If you always make the right decision, the safe decision,
the one most people make, you will be the same as everyone else.

<span style="color: #800000;"><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Curiosity</span></strong></span>

The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity!
~ Albert Einstein

Seize the moment of excited curiosity on any subject to solve your doubts; for if you let it pass, the desire may never return, and you may remain in ignorance.
~ William Wirt
